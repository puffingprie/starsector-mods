Our fleet has been discovered by a fleet of local religious fanatics. Their lack of understanding would have them attempt to destroy the ARK before we can finish our operations in this sector.

We cannot allow them to learn of the location of the ARK, defeat them now before their search draws them any closer to its location.

Hoka carries an invaluable sample of Geo Cells, the loss of this vessel is unacceptable.
