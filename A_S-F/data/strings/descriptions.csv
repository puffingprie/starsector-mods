Similarly to the more common Gryphon, the Peryton also has a relatively underpowered flux core for its size, but if it is able to sit at a distance behind other fleet assets and unleash a steady barrage of missiles, this weakness is unlikely to be a major concern.",,,,
A_S-F_gaoler,SHIP,"The Gaoler is a hull designed to act as a relatively lightweight fighter platform, although rather poorly armed and lacking in the dedicated fighter support systems typically seen on heavier carriers it instead features a pack of Shackle class drones.

Shackle class drones are armed with a unique Disruption Mortar which is modelled on the more common Light Mortar, but instead of the standard explosive shell loads a specialised warhead that unleashes a burst of broad-spectrum radiation on detonation, this is capable of overwhelming and disabling even hardened systems with sufficient quantities of repeat fire.",,,,

The Gleam is an advanced testbed for esoteric technologies, mounting a prototype of the Temporal Shell system that exists in a more refined form on the Scarab.

The Lustre is a mystery, the first recorded sightings were during the the second AI war, the sparse and limited records are largely fragmentary and with no identifiable links to any known Tri-Tachyon designs the first sightings were initally passed off as sensor glitches or even outright fabrications, but in the years past repeated and more well documented sightings have proven it to be worryingly real.

At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Splendor was developed by competing design team as a competitor to the Brilliant and while less prevalent in AI fleets it still remains a reasonably common sight. One interesting feature of this hull is the presence of what appear to be vestigial allowances for crewed usage, although the majority of such features have since been packed with munitions storage or have power conduits running straight through them, showing that such considerations were abandoned at some point relatively late in the design process.",,,,
A_S-F_nebel,SHIP,"A unique vessel, the Nebel appears to be an extremely heavily modified version of the Splendor droneship featuring a fully fleshed out crew compartment. A specialised missile foundry has also been installed in the core of the vessel, giving this ship the potential to be far more deadly than other ships of the same weight class and when combined with it's superior combat mobility it can pose as a threat to even capital grade vessels.",,,,
A_S-F_auditor_mod,SHIP,"Heavily customised variant of the Auditor designed to optimise defensive and anti-fighter capabilities.

This custom modification of the Auditor attempts to go back to its core origin in the Monitor, discarding attempts at increased firepower and instead installs a pair of customised ""Shevalye"" PD Systems giving it unsurpassed point defense capability for a vessel of its size.",,,,
A_S-F_velox,SHIP,"An ultra mobile lightweight frigate, while the Velox is able to mount a very respectable strike package in order to make the most out of its strike potential it must sacrifice point defense capabilities.

A favorite of admirals who favour the wolfpack school of combat, the Velox's effective shielding and impressive speed make it reparkably survivable and give it ample opportunities to take advantage of narrow windows of vulnerability.",,,,
A_S-F_buraq,SHIP,"The Buraq is unusual as far as missile focused vessels go as it only features a single mount for missile weapons but a massive portion of internal space is dedicated to munitions storage for that one weapon, this makes it highly specialised based on the installed weapon but with prodigous ammunition supplies it is able to bring the most out of it.",,,,

The Auspice acts as a front line support vessel, in that it ""supports"" its allies by crippling lighter targets with its medium energy mount and disabling larger ones with its EMP Emitter.",,,,
A_S-F_rinka,SHIP,"The Rinkas ability to mount a rather heavy armament for a frigate makes it popular among mercenaries and hotshot captains alike, but such aggressive loadouts will often lack in practical armaments for dealing with strikecraft and missiles, which can lead to it being relegated from practical usage in larger engagements.",,,,
A_S-F_transparence,SHIP,The Transparence is a unique prototype ship featuring a wide variety of bleeding-edge technologies.

A_S-F_incisor,SHIP,"A lightweight support fighter, able to provide minor beam suppression and Point Defense at a respectable range. While the Incisor is incapable of dealing notable damage to even the lowest quality shield emitter, the threat of armour ablation proves sufficient to allow the craft to force captains to keep their shields active when under fire.",,,,

While sharing some design features with discarded prototype hulls, its origins are as much of an unknown as the source of the variety of advanced technologies crammed into its hull. The Niteo pushes temporal manipulation technology to an impressive extreme, cementing its place as one of the most feared vessels encountered in AI remnant warfleets.",,,,
A_S-F_triarii,SHIP,"Designed as a ship of the line, the Triarii features a somewhat underwhelming weapons load but makes up for it with a solid array of defensive measures and a respectable flux core for a ship of its size.

One of the core features of the vessel is the rapid fabrication and control system for a bank of armoured ""Panel"" drones, they provide a disposable screen against incoming fire, and the deployed drones also carry small sensor relays allowing them to act as a distributed sensor net, enabling the ship to engage opposition at slightly extended ranges.",,,,

The Axicon acts as a heavy duty platform to support other droneships in combat, it packs a specialised autoforge that deploys groups of Ammon Attack Drones, when combined with the vessels standard flight decks and missile armament it is able to deliver effective pressure from a great distance.

While the Ammon drones are an excellent distraction, their survivability is sub-par as their compact size leaves no room for a shield emitter, they also run an overcharged power core that has issues with stability which will short out and detonate after only a relatively brief operational period in combat.",,,,

There are some design similarities with the more ""common"" ArkTech vessels that are rarely spotted across the sector, but they are joined by numerous layers of redundant armouring with an almost organic design in some areas.

While the Estucheon may appear to be the result of a corrupted production chip at first glance it is in fact a true designed vessel.
