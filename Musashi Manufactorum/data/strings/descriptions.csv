mm_susanowo,SHIP,"Susanowo class capital ship is designed to act as a fortress patroling Musashi's home planet during the Age of Foundation of Forges. Designed by Musashi himself, the design derives hevily from the Dreadnought of the old world. Designed to be built with limited access to technology at that time, the ship is equipped with atoomic-piston driven turrets that shot out gigantic titanium shells. After the Age of Foundation of Forges, Musashi start to look for more advance design with better power/tonnage ratio and the Susanowo was dropped from the fleet composition. Last of its kind, Susanowo continues to serves as Musashi's personal headquarter for almost two more decades before he transit to [Redacted]. Currently, ""Susanowo the Last"" is on eternal duty to guard Musashi's home system.",,,

mm_bishamonten,SHIP,"The Bishamonten class, also known as the Ghost of Musashi, is a legendary design and the most advanced ship ever built by Musashi Manufactorum. It was once Musashi Manufactrum's pride and joy, built in Musashi's personal shipyard. The design is derived from South Dakota class battleship of the Old Earth. The ship is built around the first Rubioplasmic Reactor prototype powered by Rubion, a highly volatile and high energy-to-weight ratio minerial from their home system. It integrated three Alpha AI cores to help operate the reactor and control its volatility. The first AI core is in charge of running the engine, the second of distributing power across the systems, and the third of supervising ship system commands.

The ship is equipped with the first iteration of Musashi's Relic Ammo Feeder, which increases the rate of fire, reduces flux use, and increases ammunition driver energy, resulting in greater ammunition impact. Unfortunately, the AI cores on the ships have been corrupted by the Rubion radiation emitted by the reactor. Finally, the AIs turn against Musashi's fleet, resulting in a disastrous Rubio-AI war. The Musashi home start system was nearly wiped out, and the Bishamonten class design was abandoned. 

In contrast, you discovered only three Beta AI Core in this newly acquired ship. Could this be a prototype? You'd never guess, but given its dominance, one has to wonder how much more powerful the real one would be...",,,

mm_mikaboshi,SHIP,"Mikaboshi class capital ships are semi-carriers which some considered a more versatile version of Amaterasu. The large ballistic slot at the rear of the ship has been replaced by carrier 'houses' in the design. This 'house' provides comfortable space for fighter crews, while the extended-wing design provides a clear view of the battle field for squadron operators. The design is inspired by the Yamato from the Old Earth. The ship system incorporates the well-known Musashi Super Feeder, which increases fire rate and lowers flux cost of all ballistic weapons, while the hull incorporates advanced Musashi's targeting computer, which extends the range of ballistic weapons. Because of Musashi's background in the heavy energy industry, it has heavy armor and good overall flux management. It also features five fighter hangars for ground operation.",,,
mm_amaterasu,SHIP,"Amaterasu class capital ship is the current flagship design of Musashi Manufactorum. The unusual layout is inspired by Yamato, one of the most famous war machines from the 20th 'Old Earth' century. Its sleek aerodynamic design awed nobility and commoners alike back then. Despite the fact that aerodynamics aren't very useful in space, Musashi insists on keeping the elegant hull design. Amaterasu has been at the forefront of Musashi Manufactorum fleet since the Rubio-AI war and will continue to be so in the future to come.

The ship also has traditional Old Earth weaponry. It provides unrivaled broadside firepower as well as numerous point defenses.

mm_fell_amaterasu,SHIP,"Programmed to be self-destructed when taken over by unauthorised party, It is almost impossible for anyone to capture the Amaterasu with it's Rubioplasmic Reactor intact. However, in a rare occurance some might stumble upon one with a semi-intact reactor. After the wreck was towd to a shipyard, hours of work of ingenious engineers is required to bring the semi-destryoed Rubioplasmic Reactor to life. One way to achieve this is by attaching another standard reactor to it to help support the generation and power management. The standard reactoe would then act as both a jumper and assitive engines. This result in hack-ish design but still fearsome battleship. Nowadays, many pirates and mercernary employ the Fell Amaterasu as flagship of their fleet.",,,

mm_kuzuryu,SHIP,"Musashi Manufactorum vows never to design an AI-integrated ship with a Rubioplasmic Reactor again after [REDACTED]'s betrayal. However, when an extraterrestrial invasion begins in the 26th Old-Earth Century, they are forced to devise novel solutions for their own survival. Kuzuryu's Off-Hull-Rubioplasmic Reactor is their solution. The ship is designed with restricted main turret arcs to limit its function, limiting its user for other roles and making it more manageable if necessary. The design is derived from Iowa class battleship of the Old Earth.

The Off-Hull-Rubioplasmic Reactor, as the name suggests, is a reactor built outside the hull with an integrated AI socket. The Off-Hull restricted AI control to only armaments, lowering the risk of corruption inside the vessel. This causes visible Rubionplasmic tendrils to form around power channels running the length of the ship.

mm_rubionblastcannon,WEAPON,"The Onryo Rift Cannon is a prototype rubioplasmic weapon designed to be used exclusively with [Redacted]. A battery of five such weapons allowed Musashi to dominate his home system, leading to an era of progress lasting until the Rubio-AI War. 
After the war, the design was scrapped, as no post-war ship had the specs to handle the weapon reliably. 
Earlier iteration had a single «barrel» firing devastating rubioplasmic blasts, but later revisions were reconfigured to fire a double salvo of smaller «shells», a change welcomed by engineering crews. Even the more efficient arrangement generates excessive heat, which necessitates prolonged cooling and service between salvos. 
A discharge powerful enough to spark rubioplasmic reaction is a violent shock to any ship's systems. Not every power grid could handle such a capacity, and even fewer could do so more than once, and not without some precautions.
