nskr_prosperity,SHIP,"Revealing the true scale of the Kesteven military industrial complex. The Prosperity project took a multi billion credit budget and centuries long development cycle, but now that it's here it creates a true fleet in being for the corporation. Best in class forward firepower and speed allow this battleship to annihilate the heavier vessels of an opposing force in mere moments. 

The Prosperity project started long before the collapse as plans to create a replacement battleship for the Onslaught-class, but over the many years of development the project spiraled into delays and budgeting issues eventually being put on hold indefinitely. Post-collapse the corporation was desperate to get their hands on capital class blueprints, so a questionable amount of funds from the DRA were diverted to finish the Prosperity project. Despite nearly crashing the economy, another decade in the making and only partially completing the original plans. The unveiling of the first functional Prosperity-class advanced battleship, was in the end considered a huge propaganda victory for the corporation.",,,,

nskr_nighthawk,SHIP,"Workhorse of Kesteven fleets, the Kesteven Konstruktion defense products line ""Nighthawk"" is a very recent design, making use of the latest advancements in spaceship production. While it failed to gain any significant market share pre-collapse, the rather complex design and expensive maintenance severely limited its popularity. Its blueprints are now put to good use by the Kesteven corporation. It serves a relatively simple role in fleets, acting as line ship with excellent firepower and respectable durability.",,,,

nskr_devilcatcher,SHIP,"Fast paced aggression at a premium, the defense products line ""Devilcatcher"" is a top end fast cruiser with uncompromising design. The unorthodox engine system allows for unmatched speed and agility, at the cost of a rigorous and precise maintenance procedure. Since even a small error could lead to a catastrophic P-space cascade during system activation.",,,,

nskr_mercenary,SHIP,"The ""Mercenary"" class, a slick top of the line vessel for the wealthy independent captains of the sector. Kesteven defense products assures that the ample armor, wide turret arcs and the projectile deterrence field provide best in class performance for escort duties.",,,,

nskr_blackbird,SHIP,"Kesteven Konstruktion defense products line ""Blackbird"", was a barely finished design in its late prototype stage pre-collapse. It was quickly rushed to production and put to good use during the events of the collapse. Now in Kesteven fleets it serves as a highly aggressive attack platform built for swift assassination of critical enemy vessels, a role in which the Blackbird-class excels in.",,,,

nskr_dragontail,SHIP,"The fastest serial production frigate ever built and with incredible agility to match, well at least according to Kesteven marketing material. The Dragontail-class moves with implausible speed and defies time with its pullback system, allowing for daring daring maneuvers against slower enemy vessels.",,,,

nskr_kingstork,SHIP,"The first design unveiled by the at the time newly formed Kesteven Konstruktion defense products branch. The Kingstork-class is a well liked and much more popular design than other Kesteven hulls, thanks to its well proven and simple design. It performs well in escort roles and as a close range brawler as a result of its excellent shield, although the low top speed can leave it very vulnerable when pitted against larger vessels.",,,,

nskr_kingslayer,SHIP,"A symbol of anarchy to come, the Kingslayer-class is a ruthless combination of speed and firepower. Said to be the brainchild and the life's work of a severely disgruntled engineer, built at some covert dockyard from salvaged and retrofitted ship parts with uncharacteristic care. The Kingslayer only brings rampant destruction in its wake, it is the antithesis to the order of the Domain and their successors. It has reached mythical status among spacers that have seen it in action and lived, more legend than reality and only spoken of with dread. It is far more capable than a post-collapse design has any right to be.",,,,

nskr_stalwart,SHIP,"A modern experimental design, made to excel at fleet support roles with non-standard missile systems. The Stalwart-class was designed at the same time as the more common Champion-class as a sister ship, to be an economic support oriented alternative. It faced the same list of lengthy issues as the Champion that prevented pre-collapse adoption. Now in the post-collapse sector, and after some blueprints were recovered, it's an uncommon but reliable cruiser that can shine when put in the right situation.",,,,

nskr_verity,SHIP,"The apex of Domain-era electronics and energy weapons system. The Verity-class was the latest in spaceship engineering that appeared in market just before the collapse. Demanding skill and precision the Verity can be tough to pilot, but rewards with rapid and flexible damage output where needed with its high mobility and range.",,,,

nskr_rhea,SHIP,"A shockingly advanced Pirate made design with incredible firepower, that can quickly catch a careless commander off guard. The Rhea creates chaos on the battlefield like no other, its glass cannon design favors the brave and mad captain alike. Although feared in combat it thankfully remains an uncommon sight in the sector, due to its design requiring more advanced production methods and skilled engineers to manufacture than your average Pirate hack-job.",,,,

nskr_borealis,SHIP,"The Borealis-class vessel is an effective mix of advanced scientific and military technologies, perfect for long-range exploration of hostile space. Fitted with multiple military grade fighter bays, top of the line high-power sensors, and advanced electronics that can boost the combat capabilities of an entire fleet of ships. The Borealis is an excellent support vessel, but is rarely seen due to the very high cost of construction for a more civilian ship.",,,,

nskr_reverie,SHIP,"One of the most agile cruisers ever built. The Reverie-class is almost impossible to pin down without overwhelming numerical superiority. The flexible weapons load-out allows for excellent strike capabilities making the Reverie one of the most deadly hit and run vessels in the sector. Armed with the missile salvo which is an early variant of the more infamous and feared mine strike, while not quite as lethal it still can deliver serious damage to hostile targets.",,,,

nskr_malediction,SHIP,"The Malediction is an extremely advanced fast attack platform rivaling the combat prowess of the Tempest. An absolute menace to other frigates and slower ships that it can easily outmaneuver. Comes built-in with Pursuer attack drones, an experimental weapons drone with the latest technological advancements in it that the Tri-Tachyon Corporation has to offer built-in.",,,,

nskr_pursuer,SHIP,"The Pursuer is an experimental weapons drone with the latest advancements delta-core AI technology built-in. It excels at harassing undefended or distracted ships, while The Malediction can do the heavy lifting. The volatile EM core offers an explosive surprise to unsuspecting targets, allowing it to deliver damage far above its weight class.",,,,

nskr_rorqual,SHIP,"The Rorqual-class was the pinnacle of Rogue Co. engineering, pushing the limits of what was thought to be possible. With unique over-charger engine systems and the trademark flux anomaly discharger tech. These vessels were known to be absolute beasts in combat with such well rounded stats that there is almost no weakness. The Rogue Company was a group of the best engineers, privateers and smugglers pushing the boundaries of ship performance and engineering with every ship custom built and hand tuned for maximum performance. Since the collapse almost all of their tech has been lost to time, so only a handful of ships survive to this day.",,,,

nskr_reverie_boss,SHIP,"The flagship of a rogue AI-core that somehow got its hands on a custom Reverie with systems pushed far beyond what is reasonable. With its unique ""Void"" power core pulling impossible levels of power tearing reality itself apart. This ship will make a swift end to those who dare to oppose it.",Unidentified Vessel,"UNKNOWN ENTRY

The early years of the post-collapse chaos were make or break for the fledgling corporation, many sacrifices and concessions had to be made to keep the economy afloat. High military spending has kept the enemies of Kesteven at bay throughout the years of the post-collapse, but often a more diplomatic solution is required. And Kesteven officials are more than happy to use their economic prowess to extort, manipulate and sponsor the rest of the sector to keep possible threats at an arms length. The most important client the Hegemony maintains a heavy influence over Kesteven business. Asteria is a major source of economic power and growth so an uneasy alliance is maintained.

The Democratic Republic of Asteria controls everyday life on the planet. Although democratic in name, politicians and officials with more business friendly policies towards Kesteven and its subsidiaries are suspiciously likely to get elected.
