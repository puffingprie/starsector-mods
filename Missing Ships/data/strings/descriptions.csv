missp_albatross,SHIP,"Designed as a Heavy Carrier, the Pelican-class offers superior performance across the board to many of the warships currently operating in the Persean Sector. Mounting an impressive array of weapons while maintaining a massive fighter capability provides this ship with substantial force projection capabilities in the theater of operations.

The Pelican is the ‘Cruiser School’ response to the criticisms levied against the aging Legion-class Battlecarriers. The sacrifice of heavy weapon mounts does hinder the ability of the carrier to effectively remain on the line of battle, but this is more than made up for the Carrier’s superior battlespeed and cavernous hangar bay. When paired with faster warships to pin hostile vessels in place, the flood of strike craft launched by the Pelican can easily overwhelm even the thickest of point defense screens.

Building upon the lessons learned by the Drover-class light carriers, Orion Shipyards submitted this design as an alternative to the more specialized Astral-class of Tri-Tachyon corporation in the competition to fulfill the ‘New Fleet Prerogatives' posed by the Domain Armada. Ultimately, this design was preferred by the ‘Big Gun’ school of admirals, who were unwilling to accept the loss of direct combat potential represented by the Astral’s design. The introduction of the Pelicans to the Domain’s fleets was in its opening stages when the Collapse shattered the Gate Network, stranding a number of these vessels in Persean Sector. Their service continues in the hands of the Domain’s numerous successor states, where they have met substantial success as both line combatants and as fleet command ships.",,,
missp_staple,SHIP,"Favored for the sheer tactical flexibility offered by its superior weapon arcs, protection, and speed, the Staple was designed to excel in any role it is assigned to. The centerline-mounted heavy weapons arrangement, gives the ship immense flexibility. It is not an uncommon sight to see Staples charging headlong into enemy warfleets alongside the Onslaughts they were meant to replace then float next to Pegasi or Paragons striking and crushing enemys on other occasions.

As strategic doctrines in the Domain Armada shifted from large capital ships toward more versatile cruisers in the years preceding the Collapse, Naval Strategists were confronted with the serious issue of obsolescence in their heavier warships. While the venerable Onslaught-class could still serve as a line-breaker and nigh-invincible juggernaut, the design limitations of its hull had become evident in the face of faster and technologically superior ships. However even the staunchest radicals among the ‘Cruiser School’ Admirals, recognized the need for dedicated capital ships in some of their fleet compositions and thus put out the call for designs to fulfill their demands, codified in the ‘New Fleet Prerogatives’. 

The Staple-class was the outcome of pushback, the ‘Big Gun’ Admirals had against the Conquest-class. Based on a earlier heavier iteration, a revised design was fitted with more PD mounts, with the popularization of modern strike craft was now fully underway. The resultant design, now accepted, was named the Staple-class. The Staple became Orion Shipyards entry for the category of dedicated warship, where it straddled the line between, Alpha Strike capablility, protection and sustained firepower; all while behing swifter. Well-rounded, adaptable, yet still cost-effective, the Staple won the favor of both the ‘Big Gun’ and ‘Cruiser School’ Admirals; behing choosen over Tri Tech and Altair Exotechs entrys. Introduction of the Staple was well underway by the time of the Collapse, and the design remains a somewhat common sight in the Persean Sector’s larger navies where it continues to serve with distinction.",,,
missp_midline_patrol_craft,SHIP,"The final word in fighter design, the Claymore is one of the largest and most powerful Patrol Craft currently in use. Equipped with significant armor and a substantial armament, this fighter is more akin to a carrier-based frigate than to a conventional strike craft. It is capable of directly engaging and overwhelming ships of significantly larger size, or eliminating swarms of fighter craft in a single pass, and has the maneuverability to dodge thick clouds of point-defense fire with ease. Claymores are often deployed alongside large fighter or bomber wings to ensure that a single wave can maximize both space-superiority and anti-ship capability without the need for to deploy larger carriers.",,,
missp_chrysaor,SHIP,"A fleet carrier drawn up from the propulsion systems of a missile battlecruiser that never came to be. The Chrysaor class is designed to give vanguard units, the polish to their edge needed to obliterate any counterpart forces their adversaries can send out. Completely rejected by virtually any ‘big gun’ admirals the ship still found usage in newer battlegroups. 

Distinguished by superior endurance and agility the Chrysaor class is able to offer support to the most swift and aggressively designed and captained Task Forces. Thanks to advanced weapon mounts, even a suprising amount of direct striking capability can be achived by the fleet carrier; at the cost sacrificing some pointdefense capability.

The missile aspect also realised in a similar aspirational design initiative, Altair Exotech calculated good odds to make a return on their investment after the initial failure.",,,
missp_nagato,SHIP,"The near mythical Nagato super-dreadnought, a project conceived in the same era of the Deployment of the Domain's Exploratum Drones, was designed to be a naval anchor for military operations in a sector, and to be a mobile HQ for domain operations in foreign space.

The ships absolutely staggering armament, material and crew requirements made this ship not only expensive, but unfeasible leading into the implementation of lower-level AI subroutines in ship systems (courtesy of heavy Tri-Tachyon lobbying and investment), the Nagato still stands as a relic of the forgotten glory days of the Domain, and should one be resoureful, or just downright crazy enough to get one of these on their hands, they could very well decide the fate of the sector with its bristling armament, near-impenetrable armor plating, its surprisingly numerous fighter bays, and staggering mobility for a ship of its size.",,,
missp_pelagornis,SHIP,"Equipped with Nanoforges of the size and power to rival planet-based manufacturing, the Pelagornis-class Super-Carrier is essentially a fleet unto itself; the sheer number of strike craft it can deploy can easily overwhelm any target in a matter of moments. In addition, the ship is able to mount significant arrays of weapons that place its direct firepower in excess of even the Onslaught-class. A true worldbreaker given form, this ship is the crowning jewel of the Domain’s ambitions.

Among the tales told by the aging members of the spacefaring community, none were as fantastical as those surrounding the legendary Pelagornis. Regarded as little more than myth or the result of armchair-admiral debate, this design was never acknowledged as genuine or feasible by the Domain Armada.

The existence of this ship tells a very different story. While the Nagato was to be the future standard of the Domain’s frontline ships, the Pelagornis was secretly developed as the be-all and end-all of fleet command technology, capable of coordinating the entirety of the Armada from a single platform. The reason for such secrecy was due to the greatest weapon in its arsenal: within the massive CIC was the WarMind, an abominable fusion of two Alpha-level AIs and a still-living human brain. All ship systems were directly slaved to this central intelligence, which was necessary for the ship to even function. However, the WarMind’s human component was left in a state of utter agony as result of its integration, and in early trials, the intelligence proved to be ambitious, unreliable, antagonistic, and above all, imaginative. Ultimately, the Domain Admiral’s sense of morality and paranoia won out over any practical arguments, as the original Pelagornis and the WarMind were destroyed and never further developed.

Perhaps it is best that this technology remains lost. The Domain abandoned this design for a reason.",,,
missp_path_ragnarok,SHIP,"‘And so, God, upon seeing his children on the brink of obliteration, spoke one final Word with which to undo their hubris. The word became steel and made its dwelling among the stars. The faithful, illuminated by Ludd’s pyre, have seen this steel and rejoiced, for salvation shall fall from the heavens as a mighty Hammer, full of truth and love for all.’ – Canticles of Ludd, Chapter 73, Verse 112.

Alternatively known as the Cathedral of Galactic Redemption, the Holy Instrument of His Will and Word, and, most fittingly, the Hammer of Ludd, The Ragnarok is the final doom of technologist heretics.

A floating scrapheap held together by nanogoo and faith, this mobile battlestation brings unrivaled firepower to bear against all those who would forsake Ludd’s word. Hegemonic Analysis of the Ragnarok reveals that, despite its ramshackle appearance, this vessel is perfectly capable of going toe-to-toe with an entire battlegroup and emerging relatively unscathed. In addition, it has been proposed that the ship possesses advanced command and control technology used to direct the various Pather cells found throughout the sector.

While most every faction has placed significant bounties on the destruction or capture of this ship, the Persean League is most fervent in seeking the Ragnarok’s destruction for one simple reason: it is believed by League Admiralty that the Pather cells that destroyed Mairaath were based off of Ragnarok, which was sighted in-system only a few days prior to the doom of Mayasura.",,,
missp_anchor,SHIP,"Anchor is rumored to be designed outside of the sector post collapse, entering the sector several decades after the gates went silent. Such rumors are credible, given the ships ability to remain in space indefinitely without resupply due to its integrated nanoforges producing both supplies and fuel as well as its hydroponic bases spread all over the ship. However its main boon comes from its cargo and fuel capacity, being able to carry enough cargo to supply entire planets with provisions for months. Not only that, its personal capacity is station sized, able to establish number of outposts in a single run. All the while maintaining capital sized weaponry and ability to fend of pirate fleets or even an odd military capital ships. Drawback comes from its combat deployment, with its size and lack of maneuverability, not many other ships dare to be deployed along it and its own combat profile is also extremely high. However, its undisputed that having one of these ships solves any and all cargo issues a fleet or even a whole faction can have.",,,
missp_dominion,SHIP,"Ship of the same age as the mighty Invictus, this piece of history was one of the first carrier designs to ever set sail in the Domain space. As this ship was made during era in which modern shields were but a myth, it has no forward facing hangars, so as to shield its crew and its ordinance from spaceborn threats. Likewise to the Invictus, this design also possesses extreme amount of armor, effectively making it into some kind of a battle carrier design, even if during its inception such doctrine was unheard of. Much like its gun line cousin, this ships main armaments are large forward facing guns, able to wrestle with whole fleets at a time, while its massive hangars spew forward dozens and hundreds of fighters to overwhelm even the most well protected advesaries. Due to its sheer size, it houses entire decks filled to the brim with ready made fighters that can be quickly put to action, should the engagement require it.",,,
missp_buffalomkiii,SHIP,"With the increasing hostilities in the sector, independent traders and mercenaries could no longer hang onto production capabilities of major factions. Several Independent corporations and warlords decided to put together their own warfleets, with their domestically produced designs. However weird and haphazardly made these ships are, they are Independents own ships, capable of standing up for themselves and protecting the independent spirit of the sector. 
A major conversion of the standard Buffalo-class freighter hull, the Mk III sacrifices almost all of its cargo capacity in exchange for mounting twin Fighter Bays, equipped with military-grade Nanoforges and the support facilities necessary to maintain constant fighter patrol. This revision is a desperate attempt by civilian authorities to provide trade convoys with some level of protection against increasing pirate activity. While the effectiveness of such a haphazard escort carrier has yet to be substantially proven in direct combat, no freighter captain would pass up the opportunity to fly under fighter escort.",,,
missp_nyx,SHIP,"With the increasing hostilities in the sector, independent traders and mercenaries could no longer hang onto production capabilities of major factions. Several Independent corporations and warlords decided to put together their own warfleets, with their domestically produced designs. However weird and haphazardly made these ships are, they are Independents own ships, capable of standing up for themselves and protecting the independent spirit of the sector. 
The Nyx is a general destroyer-class design, meant primarily to act as the stone wall between a vulnerable convoy and the mass of pirates and other desperate elements in the Persean Sector that wish to prey on them. Very heavily armored for its weight, the design offers substantial broadside firepower and decent maneuverability in a fairly compact package, making it a versatile convoy escort craft. Some of the more desperate navies in the Sector have taken to adopting the Nyx as their primary light line warship. The true strength of the design is in its comparatively cheap cost and ease of construction – the most successful of Nyx flotilla tactics involve overwhelming enemy forces with sheer weight of numbers.",,,
missp_nebula_lander,SHIP,"With the increasing hostilities in the sector, independent traders and mercenaries could no longer hang onto production capabilities of major factions.

However weird and haphazardly made these ships are, they are Independents own ships, capable of standing up for themselves and protecting the independent spirit of the sector. 
Ubiquitous Nebula liner converted into an atmospheric lander. Originally concieved by now unknown mercenary group, which wanted cheaper and better armed lander than Valkyre, but didnt want to use the stigmatized pirate Colossus conversion, which also has significantly higher support profile. So, a Hedgehog was born. With massive structural enhancements and numerous weapon mounts added, it can provide significant direct fire support to landing units. It can also serve in an anti-ordinance duties, given its many turret mounts and generous firing arcs.",,,

However weird and haphazardly made these ships are, they are Independents own ships, capable of standing up for themselves and protecting the independent spirit of the sector. 
Warliner represents the spirit of the sector in a way. In that it will take any remnants of the golden days of humanity, put massive weapons and hangars where possible, and use it for war. Entire aft of the ship has been cut out and replaced with sizable hangar bays with military grade nanoforges, providing its fleet with significant ordinance capabilities. Along with these upgrades, whole of the ship has been pierced through by heavy reinforcements, sometimes going straight through cargo bays, living quarters and other secondary sections. Lastly, numerous weapon mounts have been added to the whole length of the ship, effectively turning it into a battlecarrier, however weird that definition is, when placed onto former Starliner.",,,

Several Independent corporations and warlords decided to put together their own warfleets, with their domestically produced designs. However weird and haphazardly made these ships are, they are Independents own ships, capable of standing up for themselves and protecting the independent spirit of the sector. 
Hogtarsus is cheaper alternative to the forminable Nyx-class destroyers, and considerably faster too. Its an answer to the protection of the bottom line. After all, it doesnt matter all that much which ship is protecting convoys, if it can pull its weight, its enough for the corporations, warlords and mercenaries alike. 
Boasting two medium turrents welded on lifted mounts, this Tarsus conversion works well in fleet support role, either providing medium range firecover for its more armored brethen or providing excellent flak coverage against enemy ordinance.",,,

The Gamble-class light Battlecruisers are a versatile solution to the issue of capital threats to merchant fleets and anti-capital capabilities of mercenary companies. Essentially an upgunned Venture-class Cruiser, offering two large ballistic mounts and numerous smaller mounts for anti-ordinance duties, this light battlecruiser can flank and scrap most capital ships in moments, given chance. However, due to improvised built of this hull, it has even weaker armor than vanture cruisers, even if its somewhat made up by significantly enhanced hull integrity.",,,
missp_flak_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Flak Craft is a dedicated fleet escort corvette, and is primarily deployed ahead of charging formations to intercept incoming missile ordinance and dissuade incursions by enemy fighters. Built around a center-mounted Flak Cannon, this craft is adept at keeping the surrounding space clear of enemy contacts.",,,
missp_gun_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Gun Craft serves primarily as a frigate-hunter. Armed with a Heavy Machine Gun, it is able to pin smaller line vessels in place and put pressure on shields while heavier craft move in for the killing blow. Additionally, this corvette is purpose-built to kill counterpart craft, mainly to eliminate the threats posed by its Flak and Torpedo variants.",,,
missp_torpedo_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The Torpedo Craft servers as an oversized bomber and is designed primarily to attack larger craft already made vulnerable by other means. Built around twin single-use Harpoon MRM tubes, this craft can deliver a devastating payload to even the most heavily armored vessels. Wise starship captains should prioritize eliminating these craft before all other fighters.",,,
missp_patrol_craft,SHIP,"One of the largest designs that a Fighter Nanoforge can accommodate, the family of Patrol Craft LPCs serve numerous specialized roles in various fleet doctrines. Corvette-sized but still retaining the speed and maneuverability of smaller bombers, these craft are often utilized in to great effect in both pitched battle and in convoy escort duty.

The standard Patrol Craft can be seen as the baseline for corvettes in the Sector. Armed only with light-mount weaponry, this corvette can fulfill any role it is placed into, but not with the same effectiveness of its more specialized counterparts.",,,
missp_broadswordmkii,SHIP,"An upgrade to the ubiquitous Broadsword, the Broadsword Mk2 further upgrades the crafts arsenal with a series of Swarmer SRMs for interception and anti-armor duty. While still likely to falter in dealing with capital sized threats, the upgrades prove sufficient for dealing with heavier fighters and frigates, while still making for an excellent bomber escort.",,,
missp_colossus_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies. Hegemony upgrades refurbished its shuttle bay as a makeshift hangar, housing a wing of fighters, giving the Colossus some screening capacity for its weaker brethen.

The Colossus is a sturdy and venerable hull well-suited to conditions in the post-Collapse Sector, albeit possessing primitive accommodations and limited defensive armament. Hegemony upgrades converted its hangar into a proper fighter bay, providing some semblance of offensive capabilities.",,,
missp_condor_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies.

The Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as this carrier-converted freighter is, for many independent polities, the easiest way to procure fighter capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good.

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,
missp_mudskipper_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony auxiliary list and as such its systems have been upgraded to military standard and a rigorous schedule of servicing enforced with the expectation that it can be pressed into military service during emergencies. Hegemony upgrades turned this vessel into a makeshift carrier, housing a single wing of Talon fighters.

Most commonly used as interplanetary ferry, the Mudskipper is indeed interstellar-capable. The ship has no built-in shield generator so must rely on its durable - for a civilian craft - armour to protect passengers and cargo. There is little hope for the Mudskipper in combat, but it is generally equipped with a rear-facing turret to foil attacks by the ever-popular Salamander missile.

The HGA-220 was first produced as the ""Pegasus""-class but was soon anointed with the altogether more humble name ""Mudskipper"". This tough little ship has been a mainstay in backwater civilian transport for centuries, and although not pretty, the rugged construction simplifies maintenance and generous bay doors allow for great versatility. To this point, the Mudskipper's image in the public mind was cemented by a somewhat unlikely holovid sequence featuring a Mudskipper transporting a herd of bovids to a picturesque arid-terraform.",,,
missp_mule_heg,SHIP,"This ship is on the Hegemony Auxiliary List and as such has been overhauled to comply with the Hegemony Auxiliary Requirements through a rigorous schedule of servicing and modifications, which has led to the already tough armor of the ship being reinforced further and its subsystems getting a substantial upgrade.

The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.

Often its captains casually ferry cargo to and fro between the star systems of the Sector alone and comfortable in the knowledge that they could afford the best protection a freighter captain can hope to get, short of an escort, of course.",,,
missp_venture_heg,SHIP,"A hegemony auxiliary refit of the rather common Venture-class Cruiser, the ship has been refitted from its humble roots as a surveying and exploration ship to a heavily armored fleet anchor. Its onboard mining drone compliment has been substituted out for a proper nanoforge, allowing it to field a single wing of ordinance, reinforcing its already significant combat capacity.

Tough, dependable and not overly expensive, Venture-class cruisers are usually constructed by private corporations for escort duty or by small non-aligned worlds for system defense.

The Venture-class ships are perhaps the most widely used civilian cruisers in the Sector. The blueprints for the Venture are widely available and can often be secured without too much trouble.

When used by small corporations, the ship is usually the pride of the fleet and is used to underpin vital operations. Due to its ubiquity, the vessel also serves with quite a few pirate outfits, where it sometimes fills the role of command ship.

Tough and dependable, the Venture is usually fitted with a good missile complement but lacks the sustained damage output needed to do well in prolonged engagements. A built-in mining drone bay provides additional defenses - a particularly good thing because the civilian-grade power generators make the shields easy to overwhelm.",,,

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space.

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship.

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming.

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,

Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector.

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration.

The Hermes is a small, dependable cargo hauler often converted for transport duty among poor frontier worlds. Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones. This firepower is meagre compared to dedicated combat ships so only a mad or truly desperate captain would employ the Hermes in front line combat.

The Mule-class is a tough nut to crack, which makes its designation as a combat freighter apt. Pirates will often bypass even a lone Mule and go off in search of easier prey.

Often its captains casually ferry cargo to and fro between the star systems of the Sector alone and comfortable in the knowledge that they could afford the best protection a freighter captain can hope to get, short of an escort, of course.",,,

Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector.

The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those front line fleets send to quash the ever-present rumbling of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,

missp_atlasmkiii,SHIP,"This conversion of the Atlas is fit with a number of converted cargo holds from Colossus-class freighters stapled onto the main superstructure. Numerous pillaged forge-vats are mounted in these converted hangars and outfit with as many LPCs as possible, enabling the ship to act as a makeshift fleet carrier. To round out its deadly arsenal, the hull is dotted with a number of weapon mounts designed to protect the carrier after it has disgorged its swarm of strike craft.

While the Persean Sector’s opportunistic underworld can be accused of many things, suicidal is the one they most often reject. Limited access to proper designs and functioning shipbuilding force these Pirate elements to scrounge and salvage for anything that gives them some chance at success. Conversions of popular freighters into makeshift warships often does the job well enough for relatively low cost, but the success of such designs is more often measured in surviving crewmembers than in tonnage of plunder acquired.

The Atlas is a favorite target of Pirate Warlords not only for the potential for good loot, but also for conversion into the Mk. II Combat Galleon. However, a number of less-than-brave captains realized that the risks in utilizing a ship that essentially amounted to a magazine detonation wrapped in aluminum foil did not lend itself to particularly long nor successful careers. The versatility and safety presented by strike craft, however, offered the perfect solution to their woes, and thus they returned to their hidden shipyards to build a newer, deadlier form of warship between bouts of debauchery and inebriation.

Necessity, the ancients said, is the mother of invention. The Atlas Mk. III is a clear demonstration of this principle put into semi-functional practice, and the surprising capabilities of this haphazard conversion has made it the mortal enemy of all legitimate shipping in the Sector.",,,

The benefit of having such a minimalistic fighter is the addition of 2 extra fighters in a wing.",,,
missp_nebulamkii,SHIP,"This once harmless civilian transport has been converted into a makeshift pirate command centre, stripping basically all the passenger cabins for fleet Command and Control systems likely salvaged off a derelict Legion. As a result, this ship is rather effective to the surprise of many privateers, as its built-in Nav Relay and ECM systems lifts the burden off the shoulder of EWAR duty from less-dedicated combat ships. The ship also sports a decent armament upgrade as well, alongside a hastily-installed nanoforge for access to a fighter escort.

The voluminous but ungainly hull of the Huan-Gogel 430 ""Nebula"" does little to enhance the romance of interstellar travel but it does ensure a respectable passenger and cargo capacity for a ship of its class. Indeed, the Nebula has slowly come to dominate mid-tier passenger service since the muted reception of its first line of production.

The Nebula is equipped with a forward-facing shield to enhance the safety of passengers and extend the hull plating's maintenance schedule. And the Sector being what it is, several ballistic turrets and anti-missile all-band flare launchers have been mounted at fortuitous locations to assure paying passengers that their well-being is a top priority of the operator.",,,
missp_starlinermkii,SHIP,"A once prestigious cruise liner, the Starliner MkII is a rather effective pirate conversion that turns the ship into a lethal instrument in pirate raids. Equipped with crude communications equipment, Electronic Warfare systems, and fleet coordination subsystems, as well as a rather hefty upgrade to the base starliners weapon package, and the shuttle bay converted into a fairly effective carrier bay, this converted battlecarrier supports its fleet with a variety of fleetwide improvements while also being a rather capable combat ship as well, making it an unexpected, yet effective tool in any pirate warlord's arsenal.

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion.

missp_expedition,SHIP,"The Expedition is among the largest civilian craft currently in use in the Sector. A post-collapse design that prioritizes survivability and function over comfort and form, this mammoth of a starship often serves as the centerpiece to every kind of civilian concern, from colony fleets to larger salvage companies and everything in-between. The combination of numerous weapon mounts, integrated command and control systems, and heavy armor plating all give this ship the ability to hold its own against many opponents when necessary. In truth, it is more akin to a mobile starbase than it is to any starship, and is most often found at the very fringes of the Sector.

Domain-era colonization policies dictated that colony fleets would be escorted by substantial naval assets, both autonomous and manned, to ensure the security of such undertakings. Given the availability of such protection in the Pre-Collapse era, the colony ships of those days consisted of little more than cryo-trays, engines, and life support. The shuttering of the Gate Network, however, made such designs impractical to use and impossible to reproduce. Hegemonic Authorities recognized that if Humanity was to survive in the isolated Persean Sector, it would have to expand. Given the growing lack of escort ship availability during the AI Wars and numerous intervening incidents, it was determined that a new ship be produced primarily to move as many people as possible with the greatest protection available in a single design. The Expedition is a result of their endeavors.

Another design born more out of necessity than to fulfill any sort of doctrinal niche, this City-with-Engines is durable, built to last, and equipped with all manner of services from hospitals to training centers to micro-forges that enable thousands to call these ships home. Curiously, the use of these ships has resulted in a sort of tradition emerging among Hegemony Officers. Captains who pass the graves of such vessels will always stop and leave behind a personal memento in or as near to the wreck as possible. Whether to mourn the loss of life, to lament the dimming future of Humanity, or to rededicate themselves to guarding the remains of civilization, the sight of a destroyed Expedition can bring even the most cynical of Commanders to a reflective pause.",,,
