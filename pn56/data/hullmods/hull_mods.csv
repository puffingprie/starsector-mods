Licenced Armor Resealer,pn_repairmod,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_repairmod,"A Blackrock licensed first gen armor regenerator, the regeneration of armor require advanced inner capacitors which heavily limits engine design and flux upgradability. Unable to mount engine, shield or flux mods.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_repairmod.png
P9 Burst Mounts,pn_magazines,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_ExpandedMagazines,"Highly resilitent capacitors coupled with advanced turret mounts that contains integrated expanded ammunition compartments allowes a %s percent increase of ammo and charge capacity for both ballistic and energy weapons, this modification also make the ship unable to mount standard magazine expanders.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_burstmounts.png
P9 PD-augmenter,pn_pdaugmenter,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_pdaugmenter,"An advanced targeting suit in addition to an enlarged flux-conduit for the top mounts works together to drastically enhance the vulcan range, though at the cost of less power routed to the forward hardpoints. +200 vulcan range, -25 percent energy weapon damage.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_burstmounts.png
P9 Nanite Gel,pn_nanitegel,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_nanitegel_v2,"Lacking normal armor, this ship is instead covered in a nanite infused gel casing. The gel greatly dampens shots and impacts while the nanites within quickly seals and regenerates any damage. However the nanites interfere with the onboard targeting computer. Strong armor regen, 90 percent resistance to nearby hull explosions and -20 percent range. Unable to mount shield mods.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_nanitegel.png
Exposed Cores,pn_cores,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_cores,Having the P9 cores directly exposed to the cold void of space allows for excessive radiation to effectively dissipate but also severely limits manually controlled vent rate and interferes with many standardized domain shield technologies. 15 percent passive hard flux dissipation and 40 percent reduced vent rate. Unable to mount Extended Shield Emitter.,,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_exposedcores.png
P9 Sensor Array,pn_sensors,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_sensors,"The presence of multitude of sensors extends sensor strength by 200/175/150/125 percent. However, the multitude of antennas removes compatibility with the standard heavy armor upgrade package.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_sensors.png
Weak Phase Field,pn_phasefield,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.pn_phasefield,"While P9 reactors and phase technology is troublesome to mix, the ship is none the less able to run a very low-grade phase field almost continuously, thereby reducing its sensor profile by %s percent.",,graphics/pn/hullmods/pn_phasefield.png
P9 Shield Modulation,CHM_pn,,,P9,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.CHM_pn,"The crew of this ship has extensive training in at modulating powerfields and subsequently also shield generators, a requirement for handling P9 core operation. This reults in %s percent hard flux dissipation and %s percent more efficient shields. This shield modulation does however also consume 5 percent more energy.","Within the P9 Colony group all servicemen are expected to have a high degree of knowledge about energy field modulation. Allows minor hard flux venting and slightly more resilient shields at the cost of sheild upkeep.",graphics/pn/hullmods/CHM_pn.png
