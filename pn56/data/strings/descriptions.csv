A captain taking this ship out without a convoy rarely gets to make the same mistake twice. Incapable of anything resembling a combat maneuver, the lateral thrusters on Buffalo-class ships are designed to merely enable it to dock when (and if) it reaches its destination.

The ship engines are the greatest contributor to hull cost, which, while low, is still within the norms for a medium freighter.

pn_colony,FACTION,"The P9 colony group is a faction that sprung up from ashes of the former Tri-Tachyon colonies within the Tolp system. Though tied tightly to the Hegemony central command the faction has somehow been allowed a great deal of autonomy in both administration and industry. Theese unique freedoms along with their dependence of their propietary reactor technology have led the P9 Colony Group to develop a large amount of new technologies post collapse hulls to an extent that is almost unheard of in the wider sector.

The Tolp system was initially settled by the Tri-Tachyon corporation as a full scale test of their experimental P-series reactors. Labeled Project Orion Leuiticus the main colony was constructed on the geologically stable and habitable Tolp II. While the technology proved wholly incompatible with the current energy infrastructure, the colony itself was a huge success. The Tri-Tachyon corporation nurtured the Tolp system to become their energy production nexus, with great investments into their P-reactor technology, building thousands of interlinked reactors on the surface of Tolp II. Within a few decades the Tolp system was the main supplier of energy for 17 different domain systems, producing the energy needed by for a total of 96 billion humans.

This was not to last however. The Tri-Tachyon corporation always had a more confrontational stance against what they saw as the consistent inefficiency of the Domain and the restrictive regulations which it enforced within its spheare of control. When the gates went down the remaining Domain politys assembled mighty armadas to quell any armed rebellion against the authority of the Domain. Though they were battered and disorganised, the vast fleets of the Domain was deemed an overwhelming foe for the Tri-Tachyon forces. As the Domain fleets set their sights on strategic fuel and energy infrastructure, the Tri-Tachyon board of directors approved of a callous plan to increase the company's power and market dominance of the Persean sector. Detonate the reactors in Tolp, strangle the Domain forces within the sector, thereby allowing the energy independent Tri-Tachyon corporation to build up and muster their forces for the inevitable conflict.

While a tactically sound idea, it was to prove fatal for the vast majority of citizens of the Tolp system. A 3 hour warning was made to evacuate the system in face of the advancing Domain, failure to comply with evacuation orders would lead to immidiate contract termination and loss of severance bonus. No mentioning was made of the impending reactor detonations. As most citizens did not think the forces of the Domain would do them harm, they stayed put. 3 hours later, the surface of Tolp II lit up like a star, and half a billion lives were no more.

The evacuation of the remaining colonists and other assets within the Tolp system was not deemed a priority by the Tri-Tachyon asset evaluation algorithm, and starports along with other essential infrastructure was bombarded from orbit to deny all company assets to the forces of the Domain. The only surviving Tri-Tachyon infrastructure being a small subterranean research facility on Tolp IV which inexplicably denied the self destruct command sent by the orbiting Tri-Tachyon fleet.",,
