CFT_arethusa,SHIP,"The Arethusa class was designed to match the travel speed of carriers and other medium to large warships so as to minimize replenishment time. Another step in this direction was to build in a salvaging system, mining drones and a large pulse mining laser to help in replenishing ordnance and stores in addition to fuel. It is sturdy enough to deploy in combat situations and is equipped with an operations center for when things get tough and more direct support is needed.",Combat Support,,
CFT_astera,SHIP,"Recognizing the Sloop as a catastrophe waiting to happen, the CFT higher-ups pushed for the development of a replacement tanker that fulfills a similar role without exploding as often. Building the ship properly has expanded materials costs to nearly three times that of the Sloop, though fuel capacity is improved as well. Despite the best efforts of the marketing bureaus, adoption of the Astrea has been slower than expected.",Combat Tanker,,
CFT_barkentine,SHIP,"A mainstay of quick-response fleets in CFT space, the Barkentine is usually deployed as a point defense boat. The twin fighter bays and over clocked LPC forge give creative fleet captains a larger-than-expected degree of operational flexibility. Crews often develop an attachment to their Barkentine's PD drone, giving it a name and viewing it as an informal fleet mascot. Do not insult its combat prowess within their earshot.",Light Carrier,,
CFT_barque,SHIP,"One of the oldest Freetrader designs still in use, rumors persist that Carter himself encoded a secret message into its design documents. Construction requires one each of the two most common derelicts in the Persean Sector: the Apogee and the Hammerhead. The front of the Apogee is joined to the rear of the Hammerhead, and the ship is complete following some minor quality control. Much speculation surrounds what is done with the remaining half of each ship. Quite maneuverable for its size.",Destroyer,,
CFT_bawley,SHIP,"A lesser-known aspect of the CFT wrecking pipeline is its software salvaging arm. The code to run their ships is just as difficult to assemble as the ships themselves - anything that can be ripped from the databanks of Pengersick’s wrecks is copied and repurposed. In the sole known case of a derelict Revenant entering the gravity well, an array of delta-level AIs was discovered generating electrical discharges seemingly without purpose. A ship was commissioned as a test bed to determine what this system did, and though it fell well below expectations the Bawley has found a role as a low-cost disabler and PD boat.",Logistics Frigate,,
CFT_bolster,SHIP,"Designed from the keel up as a dedicated salvage and mining hull, the Bolster's use in military fleets has been increasing thanks to its advanced sensors and post-battle recovery capabilities. Capable in every role except combat, more adventurous explorers have taken to flying this ship into the sector periphery unescorted. A true gem of the CFT design bureau.",Capital Logistics,,
CFT_bombardier,SHIP,"The dedicated missile boat of the CFT. Rather than the prolonged-engagement focus of similar ships, the Bombardier is designed to ensure the highest hit chance for the missiles it launches with built-in ECM and ECCM systems and a pair of Apollo wings hardcoded into the LPC forge. Can be repurposed into a semi-functional alpha-strike ship with the right loadout.",Carrier,,
CFT_bourbon,SHIP,"One of the less technologically sophisticated hulls in the CFT arsenal, the Bourbon is a successful attempt to repurpose derelict civilian offcuts for military purposes. A large proportion of the ship’s cost comes from assembling a frame strong enough to withstand a series of monstrous engines capable of propelling the battleship to over twice the top speed of an Onslaught. Mounts a repair gantry, though it is used less to repair friendly ships than it is to reattach bits of the Bourbon that fall off during battle",Battleship,,
CFT_brigantine,SHIP,"After countless pirate raids, CFT has found itself inundated with Mule parts. Apprentice salvor-engineers are encouraged to practice on these, creating whatever they can manage from the endless supply of hull sections. The vast majority of are student projects suitable only as demonstrations of basic competence to their superiors. Some show promise, but only the Brigantine has survived the crucible of Pengersick for long enough to be given a designation and incorporated into the mass production rota.",Combat Freighter,,
CFT_carrack,SHIP,"The poor man’s alternative to the Dhow, the Carrack is nonetheless a capable smuggler’s ship. Constructed via the somewhat comical method of snapping a Tarsus in half and stuffing a station-sized freight loader into the middle, the loader’s micrometeorite shield is then repurposed to baffle contraband scanners. This ship is most often deployed as part of larger CFT fleets, but has enough staying power to put a dent into the occasional overconfident pirate when fielded alone.",Heavy Hauler,,
CFT_pdplat,SHIP,"Despite looking like a pauper's station, the Cog routinely surprises the enemies of CFT by not being the slowest thing in space. A hive of built-in PD weaponry, it is a stalwart shield against the fighter- and missile-heavy battlespace of the current-day Persean Sector. Lacking the daring of an assault ship or the majesty of a capital, a posting on a Cog affords officers little prestige.",Weapons Platform,,
CFT_chester,SHIP,"The Chester was designed soon after CFT arrived in the sector, to advertise their engineering prowess to investors within the Hegemony and Persean League. At first, the Carters claimed their new ship was an undiscovered Domain-era Valkyrie variant. When they published evidence proving it had been a wreck floating in the Daevas not two months prior, the orders flooded in. Combat performance is impressive, with the ship performing flashy hit-and-run fighter strikes while still being fast enough to retreat when necessary.",Carrier,,
CFT_clipper,SHIP,"Effectively a large flying cube in its undeployed state, the Clipper is notably even less atmosphere-capable than the Exeter. During ship breaking operations the central section unfurls into a fully-featured suite of salvage drones, cranes, and support facilities for workers. A damper field and a reasonable array of weapon mounts give it good survivability in combat as well.",Heavy Destroyer,,
CFT_collier,SHIP,"A repurposing and refinement of the Clipper for military support use. Combining surveying equipment, shielded cargo holds, and a repair gantry into a single ship, the partly-automated crew of the Collier is permanently active in maintaining, outfitting, and supporting any non-combat operations undertaken by CFT. Like the Bolster, the crew is specially equipped for a combat engineering role, allowing for faster repair of severe damage after battle. A fully deployed Collier has been mistaken for a pirate space station by more than one Hegemony patrol.",Heavy Logistics Cruiser,,
CFT_coventry,SHIP,"A mature and versatile CFT hull design proven by a century of deployments. Excels against swarms of smaller ships, as there is very little space around the cruiser not covered by multiple weapons. Depending on the loadout, there is a role to be found for the Coventry from the backline to the front.",Heavy Cruiser,,
CFT_cutty,SHIP,"Designed for a very specific role in CFT fleets, the Cutty is intended to distract larger enemy ships as part of a wolfpack, creating an opening for other destroyers and frigates to move in for the kill. Weapons systems were sacrificed in favor of engines and armor, creating a fast destroyer with the armor of a cruiser. Engineers attempted to build a burn drive into the ship, but the already-overtaxed subsystems severely limit burn distance.",Heavy Destroyer,,
CFT_danube,SHIP,"The Danube is a common first command for CFT captains that eschew military officer school for the relative liberty of freelancing. As such, they are involved in more accidents than any other vessel in CFT space. On the worlds of Pengersick, a Danube displaying the unmistakable dents of unskilled piloting will be a popular target for mockery and petty vandalism. Performance-wise, the ship is a well-rounded if anemic destroyer with good mining, towing, and salvaging capabilities. Poor in combat.",Salvage miner,,
CFT_dhow,SHIP,"The cornerstone of CFT’s economy, ideology, and continued existence as an independent polity, is the act of smuggling. To that end, it is no surprise that CFT engineers are responsible for a truly revolutionary smuggling ship. The Dhow comes with specially-designed cargo containers built into the walls of the phase coils, making contraband extremely difficult to identify by external scan. With enough fuel and cargo capacity for independent operation, the Dhow can smuggle goods from one end of the sector to the other with fuel to spare.",Phase Combat Tender,,
CFT_draeck,SHIP,"Designed to keep the senior officers alive in the case of a catastrophic hull breach, the bridge of Domain-era military ships comes with a self-contained basic life-support system that can keep the crew alive even when fully removed from the hull. In need of a cut-rate tug, Charles Carter welded an engine and field stabilizer to an old destroyer bridge and called it a day. After some refinements, it has become the go-to tug blueprint for Carter's Freetraders.",Tug,,
CFT_dromon,SHIP,"The Dromon is a badge of office and symbol of prestige for CFT fleet admirals. It exemplifies the Carter family's pseudo-aristocratic tradition of 'correct' battlefield conduct - calm and collected control from a safe distance. Aggression and recklessness are the traits of junior officers, meant to be 'burned off' as they rise through the ranks. On its own, the Dromon is capable, but it truly shines as a component of a larger fleet.",Command Carrier,,
CFT_exeter,SHIP,"An absolute behemoth, CFT’s Exeter laughs in the face of common sense. A fully-shielded cargo bay that can eat a Gemini whole and ask for seconds. Engines that can outpace a destroyer with enough power to spare to launch a swarm of drones for point defense. System patrols hate seeing an Exeter on the scans, because they know that somewhere in those endless stacks of metal ore and volatiles an AI core is squirreled away, mocking their feeble attempts to find it. An unmatched addition to a fleet, if you can afford the supplies to keep it running.",Super freighter,,
CFT_foudre,SHIP,"Using an older model designed by engineer Jal that was retired from service. This updated design removes a flight bay from the original model but adds two turret mounts for added point defense protection. By taking parts from salvaged Herons, the Foudre is the brainchild of CFT designers Emto and Dazs that is the fastest carrier in CFT’s lineup. This ship gives them an excellent skirmisher that can deploy its wings in the heat of battle, quickly retreat its fragile hull to a safe distance and use the salvaged targeting feed systems to direct the flights from afar.",Fast Carrier,,
CFT_freebooter,SHIP,"There has been much speculation into why John Carter abandoned the core Domain worlds to travel to the Persean Sector. The only surviving writings on the subject are from his brother Harry, who repudiated smuggling and became a preacher with the Luddic Church. What is well-known is the ship the Carters made the journey in - itself as much of a patchwork of parts as any present-day CFT hull. The Freebooter is a replica of that first ship, subject to an extensive array of refits turning it from a civilian junker into an imposing command-and-control powerhouse. When CFT fields these, they are sending a message.",Battle cruiser,,
CFT_fusta,SHIP,"A very fast courier ship equipped with flares for defense. Its speed, mobility, and shielded cargo capability makes it a favorite among blockade running smugglers.",Corvette,,
CFT_galleon,SHIP,"In the great debate over missile optimization, there are broadly two camps. One claims that modern PD arrays can only be overcome through highly technologically advanced missile systems deployed at great fiscal and material expense. The other does this. On entering combat, the Galleon is designed to generate a cloud of missiles so dense that it can overload any Domain-era shield system through numbers alone. It does not always succeed in this, but it is nonetheless capable of placing extreme pressure on enemy fleets of any size.",Battlewagon,,
CFT_griffon,SHIP,"Depending on who you ask, the Griffon may represent CFT's first foray into original shipbuilding. An alternative explanation is that its parts have been repurposed so many times that it is no longer possible to tell what hull they originated from. A support ship built around a large drone bay with decent PD and mid-range combat capabilities in a pinch.",Drone Tender,,
CFT_ironclad,SHIP,"A legendary CFT arms procurement boondoggle, the Ironclad began life as a simple up-armored destroyer hull. A vicious cycle of corporate bidding wars and behind-the-scenes deals led to so many iterations of armor and engine modification that the final design had to be reclassified as a heavy cruiser. After initial combat trials, a phase coil was thrown in to give the ship some ability to dodge return fire. To the complete shock of its designers, the Ironclad has since gone on to have a respectable combat record.",Heavy Cruiser,,
CFT_jacht,SHIP,"CFT designers created this ship after thorough consultation with current and former marines across the sector. The Jacht can carry more troops and travel faster than the Valkyrie, making it ideal for the raiding activities so popular post-Collapse. It is also able to bring ship-scale weaponry to bear on ground targets when necessary, increasing the overall efficiency of ground support operations. The downside of all these improvements is that it is poorly armored, and falls quickly if caught unawares.",Troop Transport,,
CFT_jackdaw,SHIP,"The Jackdaw is one of a number of hulls that soak up the detritus of CFT’s other ship salvaging programs. Composed of an enormous variety of components, every surface of the Jackdaw is a patchwork of materials and technologies. Life aboard the ship is a distinctly surreal experience, as crewmembers travel through a century of ship design simply by moving from their bunk to their station. In combat, the ship relies on its damper fields and large number of mounts to both take, and deal, a greater punch than the average frigate.",Heavy Frigate,,
CFT_kerberos,SHIP,"The first Kerberos arose from an unusual question posed by a CFT fleet admiral: Could the debris from a destroyed pirate station be salvaged into a ship? While lacking any fighter or missile capability, the sheer density of overlapping firing arcs boasted by the design was enough to get it approved for full-scale production. The modern Kerberos variant no longer requires station parts to be built, and also incorporates more energy mounts. Essentially unapproachable by unsupported smaller ships.",Mobile Weapons Platform,,
CFT_knarr,SHIP,"Originally intended as a simple mining platform, multiple interest groups within CFT attempted to take control of the project for their own ends. The resulting design creep produced a ship large enough to be a capital class but has to wear a very large number of hats so only has the battle weight of a cruiser to make room for it all. A mining/exploration/combat/logistics vessel with bespoke drones and a contingent of Combat Engineers, the Knarr has so far managed to avoid descending into mediocrity and actually excels in some areas. Exploration fleets particularly value its lower supply requirements when compared to other cruisers.",Mining Support,,
CFT_lennox,SHIP,"As much as CFT admirals may wish it wasn't true, there are some assignments a Dromon is unsuitable for. Typically deployed in high-speed scouting and interception roles, the Lennox brings command-and-control to the wolfpack. A 'King's Burden' is a derogatory term among the officer class for a Lennox fitted with four Reaper missiles.",Command Destroyer,,
CFT_odam,SHIP,"The Odam is designed as a 'mini-Apogee', capable of providing logistics support to smaller fleets while avoiding the maintenance costs that come with mounting two large weapons. Technically still a cruiser, it is distinctly less capable in a fight when compared to its forebear.",Light Cruiser,,
CFT_naruebet,SHIP,"Within CFT’s officer training schools, it is said that few things predict a cadet’s command style as accurately as their reaction to the Naruebet. A pair of military-grade fighter production forges made space worthy on a budget, this ship virtually guarantees the presence of fighter support in any CFT patrol fleet. This ship has a reputation for catching pirates by surprise, as most threat assessment software classifies it as space junk.",Light Carrier,,
CFT_pinnacle,SHIP,"The Pinnacle was the first phase ship produced in large numbers by the Freetraders -  the high-tech nature of the Apogee makes it relatively easy and inexpensive to refit salvaged hulls for P-space transit. It is intended for high-speed, high-risk point capture and fleet harassment. Resentment is occasionally sown among the crew by the contrast between the cruiser-scale bridge and the frigate-scale crew quarters. harassment and distraction",Frigate,,
CFT_raven,SHIP,"The work of an influential auteur embedded deep within CFT’s most peculiar design circles, the Raven heavy destroyer is as eccentric as it is popular. With a large ballistic mount, a burn drive, and looks to kill, its siren song has incinerated the bank balance of many a small-time bounty hunter. Reckless piloting incidents are extremely high with this model, as the reverberations from the discharge of the weapons seem to lull the crew into a sort of ‘combat trance’.",Heavy Destroyer,,
CFT_retourschip,SHIP,"Traditional tanker design places fuel storage units around a minimal ship frame. The designers of the Retourschip adopted the opposite approach, building a complex interconnected hull space around salvaged Phaeton and Prometheus tanks. This inverted design provides more space for engine and weapon mounting, producing a fast-moving, high-capacity tanker with ample PD coverage.",Tanker,,
CFT_schooner,SHIP,"An infamous pet project of an eccentric CFT engineering group, the midsection of the Schooner was originally intended as a top-of-the-line assault ship. The project leads nearly came to blows during construction, as it was discovered that the salvage built into the rear of the ship couldn't support the installation of engines. Someone pointed out the huge number of unused Buffalo hulls in orbit of Prussia, and a compromise was made. Currently in use as an aggressive blockade runner.",Combat Freighter,,
CFT_scow,SHIP,"The Scow is a miniature smuggler’s ship; quick and able to hold its own. The majority of the hull is open to vacuum at all times - only the bridge and crew quarters are pressurized. CFT uses these to sneak high-value small items past system patrols, as Domain-era contraband scanners are optimized for the habitable sections of a target ship. In emergency situations, the Scow’s engines and weapons can be controlled from a single computer console on the bridge.",Combat Freighter,,
CFT_shallop,SHIP,"The Shallop veers uncomfortably close to pirate engineering for many CFT officers - a ball of otherwise-unsalvageable high-tech components and scrap hull plates welded to a phase coil and a medium missile hardpoint. No attempt is made during construction to eliminate redundant electrical systems, giving the ship a measure of EMP resistance. Shallops have a labyrinthine interior layout, with some crews preferring to disable grav-plating altogether during combat to navigate the twisting corridors more rapidly. Operates best at close range.",Frigate,,
CFT_sloop,SHIP,"A common sight in CFT space, the Sloop is a fast, cheap fuel tanker with more weapon mounts than average for a civilian ship. Due to a number of critical design flaws, the ship’s hull can split apart when subjected to relatively minor stresses. The cost of recalling and refitting every Sloop currently in service would be astronomical for the Freetraders, so this information has been quietly suppressed.",Tanker,,
CFT_triton,SHIP,"Spies and other observers of CFT struggle to determine the provenance of the Triton. The central section of the Eagle can be clearly discerned, along with what appear to be modified Heron flight decks, but the rest of the hull remains unknown. Signs of Triton worship have been found on decivilized worlds in the sector periphery - the sight of a great circle floating in the sky fascinates the humans of the Post-Collapse as much as it did their ancestors. In combat, the Triton uses its relatively high top speed to its advantage, sandwiching opponents between its fighters and its guns.",Battle Carrier,,
CFT_vasa,SHIP,"The Vasa originated as a technology test platform built out of a radiation-scoured Falcon hull. CFT researchers were encouraged to incorporate whatever systems took their fancy, leading to an unusual weapon layout as well as both mine strike and phase cloak capabilities. The ship entered regular service after scoring decisive kills on multiple Atlas Mk. II capitals during a pirate raid on Pengersick. The Vasa is highly versatile, and excels at delivering its payload where the enemy least expects it. An ideal posting for an aggressive officer.",Phase Cruiser,,
CFT_vergulde,SHIP,"The Carter’s Freetraders preference for ‘post-construction engineering’ allows them to overcome the limitations of the wider sector’s reliance on Domain-era blueprints. The Vergulde is an improvement over the Buffalo in all the ways that matter amidst the chaos of the post-collapse. A high speed, low sensor profile, and forgiving maintenance requirements coupled with a surprisingly stylish appearance make this ship a darling of civilians and smugglers alike.",Freighter,,
CFT_vestale,SHIP,"Originally plagued by design issues, the current form of the Vestale was arrived at by accident when a furious salvor-engineer removed all of the armor to achieve the top speed demanded by Richard Champion. The grey color of the ship is not paintwork, but rather hull and substructure exposed directly to vacuum. The ship fields an effective shield generator, rapid flux venting, and a pair of PD drones to compensate. Beware - overly-aggressive captains do not last long at the helm of a Vestale. ",Frigate,,
