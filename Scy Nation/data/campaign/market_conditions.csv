#Extensive mining,SCY_extensiveMining,data.campaign.econ.SCY_extensiveMining,"The most efficient mining techniques can vastly improve the production of an exploitation, but they deal irreversible damage to the environment. Fortunately, this is not a concern when exploiting asteroid belts or barren moons. Produces both common and rare ores, but increases the consumption of fuel, volatiles and heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/markets/ore_mining.png,30

#Mini Autofactory,SCY_autofactory,data.campaign.econ.SCY_autofactory,"The crown jewel of the Yggdrasill cryo arch is this miniature Autofactory. Kept in perfect working order by legions of engineers this smaller model is unable to produce as many varieties of goods as its larger standardized cousins, but managed to keep its UAC database mostly intact. Produces supplies, hand weapons, domestic goods and heavy machinery, consume metals, rare metals, volatiles and organics. Requires a substantial crew complement to operate.",graphics/icons/markets/shipbreaking.png,30

#Volatiles Smelter,SCY_volatilesMelting,data.campaign.econ.SCY_volatilesMelting,"On planets that are located a considerable distance from the star, even the most volatiles gasses freeze on the ground making their extraction much easier and less dangerous but this requires fuel to heat them up to a liquid state. Produce volatiles, but requires a significant amount of fuel, plus some organics and heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/markets/volatiles_mining.png,30

#Indoor Greenhouses,SCY_greenhouses,data.campaign.econ.SCY_greenhouses,"These underground facilities are used on worlds where outdoor farming is out of the question, whether it is because of toxicity, lack of atmosphere or radioactivity. Their production is often limited while requiring large amounts of space. Produce large quantities of food and organics, requires some volatiles and heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/markets/aquaculture.png,30

#Antimatter Collector,SCY_antimatterCollector,data.campaign.econ.SCY_antimatterCollector,"These large space-borne facilities harvest the antimatter trapped in the magnetic field of stars. While their heat-shield requires regular repairs, the production itself is quite autonomous and requires virtually nothing else. Produces vast amounts of fuel, while requiring some metals, rare metals and heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/markets/am_fuel_facility.png,30

#Space-borne Refinery,SCY_spaceRefinery,data.campaign.econ.SCY_spaceRefinery,"The ultimate refining complex, utilizing a vast array of precision-aligned mirrors to focus the infrared emissions of the star to power a high-yield and efficient furnace for processing ores. These specialized stations usually also have large docks to house a mining ship fleet. Produces metals and rare metals, require ores, volatiles and heavy machinery.",graphics/icons/markets/ore_refining_complex.png,30

#Spy Guild,SCY_spyGuild,data.campaign.econ.SCY_spyGuild,"This station is a hub of a wide spying network. Wether it is from governement sanctioned agent, or from passer-by looking to make a buck, everyone ""knows"" something, and is ready to share it for the right price.",graphics/icons/markets/pirate_moot.png,60
