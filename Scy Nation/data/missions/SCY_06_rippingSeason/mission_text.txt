Personal journal
   They really tested our skills last time, and we are in for another ride. Matel should enjoy this one as we are taking Hegemony uniforms. The briefing states that we are taking the role of a small mining operation in pirate controlled space, and get attacked by a light Scy division. We lack the firepower to repel the enemy, and we do not have enough manoeuvrability to hide in the nebula... It will likely be an ugly fight, but the setting is gorgeous: we are so close to Tartarus I feel I'm falling into it. I try not to think about the amount of radiation the hull of our ships is receiving right now.

   The other group seems to do fine, except that something happened between Michel and Orson. They don't speak to each other anymore.
