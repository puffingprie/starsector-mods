Personal journal
   I have almost no memories from the return journey, everything is blurred like a nightmare. The station took so many hits during the battle that barely anyone was left alive. The rescue teams managed to save only one fifth of the crew and that is still a miracle. They also managed to get the enemy transport back online. Every survivor was stuffed inside its cargo holds that were converted into a field hospital. All that was reusable has been recovered and we left after destroying up the hulks of the stations and disabled ships.

   Now, we are finally back. Well "we" lost most of its meaning. One dead traitor, three dead friends, Lea injured beyond medical recovery... Michel couldn't take it and resigned. I was about to do the same when Cdr. Morgan Kahl came to see me. He offered me a position as instructor for the Red Squadron. Full time, no active missions, no strings attached.

   I took it.
