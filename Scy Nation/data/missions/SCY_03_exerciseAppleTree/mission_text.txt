Personal journal
   "Let us see what they are made of." Well... The answer was "not much". While that is not a surprise to me (after all, I was a captain before my capture) but I'm sure the admiralty was not expecting us foreigners to fare so well with their ships. And while that feat gained us some respect from the other Blue members, the Yellow team now hates us. No, that is an exaggeration: we bruised their ego and they didn't like that one bit. But they will not underestimate us again, that is for sure.

   Today we start actual training for the next expedition: exercise "Apple Tree", what kind of a name is that? Briefing said we will strike a Hegemony supply convoy from an asteroid belt. That is why they moved us into high orbit around the mining outpost. While the uniform is different, I had a feeling of deja-vu whilst I was in the briefing room, with the subtle difference of course that back then those Hegemony ships would have been friendly. Matel had a weird look on his face when the nature of the target was revealed. I will speak to him after the operation.
