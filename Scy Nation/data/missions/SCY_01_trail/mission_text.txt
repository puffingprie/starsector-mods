   After more than 3 cycles of investigation, I think we are finally homing on to those unknown pirates (I can't wrap my head around calling them Skoll, but CMD Howell loves that name). They are getting bolder, or desperate because we managed to finally catch some suspicious fleet movements. Those intense probes launches cost a lot, and if this one turned out to be a cold trail I will probably have to answer some difficult questions, but I am confident it's one of their convoys we are pursuing.

   They may have been perfectly aware of our presence: the moment we accelerated to intercept them before they jumped into an uncharted system they greatly increased their speed. Fortunately they seem to be slowed down by two super-freighters. It may be a close call but we should catch them just before they reach the wormhole.
