Personal journal
   This is it! I finally am a full Scyan citizen. Since we seven are the first we had a small ceremony. We got our certificates, met with some officials, shook hands; the works. I clearly saw through their game, making us feel needed and welcome... But I would bet they want us to see through it, and to understand that while they really need us, they will not take any security risk with former prisoners either.

   Of course in my case they do not have to worry much. My companion is happy with partial citizenship, and decided to stay in Phoenix to raise our child. The others? Well the two Agrians should be fine here since their former world is a mess. I am pretty sure Matel was an officer in some fleet, so you never know. The last three I'm not even sure where they are from.

   Anyway, today is a big day: first exercise with regular recruits. Let us see what they are made of.
