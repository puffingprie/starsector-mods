Personal journal
   Matel is dead. Or at least that is the most probable outcome. The signal must have been picked up by a nearby base and they sent a response team. He managed a valiant last stand before being obliterated, but they still have a Paragon operating at full capacity. We are going back to the Outpost at full burn to face it.

   If the station was empty we could just blow it and they would never know who was there, but the refit teams are stuck waiting for a transport to pick them up. And with all the hardware that still has not been transferred we can not take the risk to let them get access to it. At least we could join with the 4th recon team and now have some decent firepower, but a Paragon? Why the heck did they send such a monster investigate a simple distress signal? Was Orson an agent from the beginning? Did he really let himself get captured to send a message once he discovered the location of Elysee?

   I am really not sure about what would be worse: that he had a change of heart and betrayed us after spending eight years together, or that he was never one of us...
