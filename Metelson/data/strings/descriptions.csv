mi_acutordrone,SHIP,"The Articu-class Drone, a staple among the arsenal deployed by the Metelson Acutor-class vessels, epitomizes efficiency and ease of deployment in the field. Outfitted with a padent system that enhances its operational capabilities, the Articu-class is engineered for rapid deployment and immediate response to a variety of tactical situations. Despite its advanced technology and utility, the drone’s primary limitation lies in its durability. Crafted with lightweight materials to maximize maneuverability and speed, it is unfortunately prone to rapid destruction under focused enemy fire. This inherent vulnerability necessitates strategic use by its operators, ensuring that its deployment capitalizes on its strengths while mitigating its weaknesses. As a critical component of the Acutor-class's tactical toolkit, the Articu-class Drone offers a blend of technological sophistication and practical application, albeit with a keen awareness of its short operational lifespan in direct confrontations.",,,
mi_collierdrone,SHIP,"The Elix-Class Mining Drone, a versatile unit in the arsenal of the Metelson Rastrum-class vessels, is specifically designed to fulfill dual roles in both mining operations and combat scenarios. Equipped with a PD laser and a Light Maser, this drone excels in its capacity to disrupt, harass, and inflict damage on poorly defended targets.

In the realm of mining, the Light Maser allows the Elix-Class to efficiently cut through asteroid materials, facilitating resource extraction in environments where traditional mining equipment might falter. The addition of the PD laser enhances its utility, enabling the drone to defend itself and its parent vessel from incoming projectiles and smaller threats, ensuring uninterrupted mining operations.

During combat, the agility and armament of the Elix-Class Drone make it a formidable opponent against ill-prepared vessels. Its ability to engage at range with the Light Maser, coupled with the defensive coverage provided by the PD laser, allows it to weaken enemy defenses while evading counterattacks. The strategic deployment of these drones can create significant challenges for adversaries, forcing them to deal with persistent harassment that can erode their combat effectiveness over time.

As a standard component of the Rastrum-class's operational capabilities, the Elix-Class Drone represents a critical fusion of mining efficiency and combat readiness. Its design reflects Metelson Industries' commitment to innovation, offering a multifunctional tool that can adapt to the diverse demands of space exploration, resource extraction, and sector-wide defense.",,,
#DRONES,,,,,
mi_negl,SHIP,"The Negl-class fighter stands as a miner's closest ally, employing a Miller Autocannon, the Negl penetrates into exceptionally dense nickel-iron asteroids that typical mining lasers might struggle against. For defensive purposes, it is also equipped with Swarmer SRMs.

This vessel represents one of the latest mining innovations conceived by the research and development team at Metelson Industries and has exhibited commendable performance since its debut, with minimal alterations to its original blueprint.",,,
mi_grudiver,SHIP,"The Grudiver-class is often humorously labeled as The Miner, the Coal Dog, and the Flying Coffin. This interceptor represents a significant enhancement over the widely used Mining Pod, now accommodating a single pilot.

The genesis of the Grudiver was a strategic initiative to refine and advance the Mining Pod blueprint, transforming it into a vessel more attuned to the needs of sophisticated spacefarers. The focal point of this transformation was to boost its resilience in the face of asteroid impacts and adversarial fire. A novel, exclusive alloy, combined with ultralight nano-ceramics, has been employed to augment its armor, allowing for a reduction in thickness while simultaneously increasing protective capabilities! This advanced armor system is mounted on a Mining Pod chassis that has been meticulously dismantled to its core structure. The outdated armor setup's removal not only led to a sleeker frame but also made room for a compact shield generator, further enhancing the craft's defensive posture.",,,
mi_golgata,SHIP,"The Golgata-class fighter serves as the cavalry, boasting heavy armaments and comparable velocity. Although swift, its agility is lacking; nonetheless, it poses a significant danger to numerous fighters and smaller naval vessels. Equipped with several Combat MGs and a Light Maser, which finds additional utility in mining operations, the Golgata stands as one of the most coveted all-around fighter models within the Sector.",,,
mi_obex,SHIP,The Obex-class bomber arguably is one of the most valuable utility grade strike craft that is commonly available in the Sector. Armed with a Light Maser and Hammer Torpedoes. Those that underestimate it quickly learn that this dual purpose craft is equally adept at both mining applications and strike duties against warships and is especially terrifying when deployed en masse.,,,

mi_vigilance,SHIP,"The Vigil-class frigate is an upgrade upon the Vigilance that packs on additional armor and another turret. Shoring up the deficiencies of the original design thus allowing it more flexibility in combat roles.

While the Vigilance-class is often deployed in fleets to provide long range fire support, it suffers when caught exposed without backup. Metelson Industries seeing the potential of the hull design modified a few Vigilance hulls and produced a variation of the ship to be deployed in small numbers within fleets on a trial basis to determine if it was worthy of additional production runs. The results from live deployments of the first prototypes was a resounding success and so it was cleared for mass production. Keeping most of the original design intact and adding only a little, the Vigil is easy to manufacture and a welcome upgrade over the Vigilance.",,,
mi_mudskipper,SHIP,"The HGA-220 was first produced as the ""Pegasus""-class, AKA ""Mudskipper"". With its common blueprints however often it is modified with disastrous results. However in Metelson's case, using their expertise in starship construction the end result while still not combat-worthy the Metelson ""Mudder"", is worth the price for what it brings to the table. Spacious cargo hold, good fuel capacity, and generous quarters for crew and passengers alike.

Most commonly used as a mining vessel among Metelson Industries fleets, like the Mudskipper it is based on the Mudder is indeed interstellar-capable. Despite having no built-in shield generator and so must rely on its durable - for civilian craft - armor to protect passengers and cargo from the elements of space travel; its maneuvering thrusters to avoid fast-moving obstacles or otherwise. While combat capable, the value of it in high intensity engagements is dubious at best, but is more than able to deal with the standard Salamander Missile or poorly equipped pirate.",,,
mi_farin,SHIP,"The Farin-class frigate is Metelson's answer to the Cerberus and is often considered superior in many respects, depending on who you ask. The Farin boasts engines with better acceleration and a shield generator. Overall this ship is a durable and viable competitor to the Cerberus.

However for all the merits of the design, its cargo capacity and overall mobility remains broadly similar to its competitor, and its power generation is capacity easily overwhelmed during intense battles. In the end if a starfarer is looking for an updated combat freighter that offers more versatility. They would be be hard pressed to find another ship quite as capable or similar to the Cerberus than the Farin.",,,
mi_cavos,SHIP,"While the Pala lacks in combat capabilities the Cavos-class is made for combat, eschewing substantial cargo bays, fuel capacity and crew comforts. Often deployed as the standard gunship in Metelson fleets as an escort, mainline combat frigate, or even to provide fire support during grand fleet engagements.",,,
mi_pala,SHIP,"The Pala-class is the pride of Metelson Industries and is marketed as a viable mining operations combat freighter, or M.o.C Freighter. With its durable armor belt and defensive turrets the Pala is able to handle its own in combat least long enough to power up its travel drive!

Its development began as a series of deep modifications to the Hound blueprint, which after successful trial runs and additional improvements to the design Metelson set out to create a new class of combat freighter for mass production and in the end succeeded. The Pala is a valuable addition to any fleet, offering combat support to larger vessels or used for freight runs and mining duties.",,,
mi_glima,SHIP,"The Glima-class frigate is an unusual design with its asymmetrical layout of turrets and hard points. But, with its unusual design comes a flexible armament loadout and the generator capacity to back it up, this ship is a potent combat frigate that is unwise to ignore.",,,
mi_roma,SHIP,"R.O.M.A Shuttle: Rescue, Operations and Mining Auxiliary is a curiously well defended transport that sacrifices much of its personnel and cargo capacity for the remarkably potent combo of both Damper and Phase fields. Infamous for escaping from situations most non-combat ships could only dream of.",,,
mi_mite,SHIP,"The Mite-class frigate is effectively a refit of the standard Kite shuttle. Commonly acquired by starfarers for its ease of maintenance, and the upgraded modular weapons package that includes conversion of the missile hard points to synergy turrets allowing for use in mining applications with the common Mining Laser.",,,
mi_wolf,SHIP,"The Stinulv-class frigate is the end result of a Metelson Industries project to modify the Wolf blueprint to their own specifications. The Stinulv gives its owners added ballistic fire power the original Wolf is incapable of wielding and a reinforced armor package at the cost of speed.

Replacing many of its core components with lower-tech but more robust and easier to manufacture parts, the Stinulv is not an upgrade upon the Wolf design and is actually inferior in several aspects. Regardless it remains a valuable ship to those that are able to acquire it and is respected for its overall combat profile.",,,

mi_securi,SHIP,"Originating from an earlier era of Metelson's design archives, the Securi-class destroyer emerges as a defensively robust yet somewhat modestly equipped combat vessel. Its deficiencies are compensated by the integration of a pilfered Temporal Shell system, marking it as a prototype.

Initially conceptualized for defensive duties with engine performance just sufficient to maintain its station near a starbase, necessitating tug assistance for repositioning. While it possessed the armament to repel fighters, bombers, and smaller warships, it was ill-equipped for extended conflict with adversaries exceeding its size. Featuring a potent power generator and flux network to energize its energy weapons and an effective shield system, its role as a static defense asset became less valuable over time. An innovative Metelson engineer envisioned repurposing the hull for offensive operations by reallocating some power to newly added thrusters. The transformation was further advanced with the illicit acquisition of a Temporal Shell blueprint from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, revealing the Securi's aptitude for managing the high energy demands of the technology. Rebranded as the Securi, the design's success took the sectorial powers by surprise, challenging the prevailing assumption of Metelson Industries' inability to produce such sophisticated technology.",,,
mi_varingur,SHIP,"An upgrade upon an ancient forgotten blueprint of old, the Varingur-class is well protected among cargo transports. While slow, this armored heap of a ship makes up for that with sheer support capability. Sporting a fighter bay, an effective overlapping grid of turrets and respectable cargo cargo capacity. The Varingur makes for an imposing target for pirates often discouraging attacks with its presence alone.",,,
mi_enforcer,SHIP,"The Custos-class is based on the Enforcer, this Metelson Industries variation replaces two of the medium ballistic mounts with small hybrid turrets and upgrades all of the frontal missile mounts to synergy types. The Custos is valued addition to a fleet for both its combat and mining capabilities.

While the Enforcer is a powerful vessel and a favorite for combat duties throughout the Sector, but it lacks in flexibility for any other task. The Custos was an attempt by Metelson Industries to not only create a class of ship that would fill the need of a heavy line combatant, but one that could be used for non-combat tasks as well. Downsizing some of its modular weapon mounts allowed for the conversion of many of the remaining ones into mounts capable of mounting both ballistic and energy based weapons. These changes allow the vessel to be used for mining operations, as well as giving it more outfitting options. These changes required an upgrade of its power generation capabilities and for all the modifications to the design in the end the armor belt had to be thinned and the shield generator downgraded as well. While many starfarers scoff at this design, the superior tactical mobility and more flexible armament options makes it a favorite for those that appreciate tact over brute strength.",,,
mi_actelh35,SHIP,"Much like the Varingur, the Actel H35 is based on technology found in old holodisks and blueprints. Built compact, tough, and slow, it is an effective long range combatant. However, it fares poorly at close quarters combat,and while powerful, the built-in cannon itself often suffers from overheating and autoloader jams. Rewarding practiced shots and captains that posses a steady eye.",,,
mi_actelh35a,SHIP,"The Actel Canopy is a very noticeable portion of the standard Actel H35. However, this revision forgoes the massive strike power of the canopy to offer a more versatile load-out on a similar frame.
Like the standard variation, the Actel H35A is for all intents and purposes a Space-Tank. While not the most fancy looking of ships- often dubbed a “Potato” -this ship is reliable, sturdy, and is quite useful as an escort with upgraded engines at a loss of armor.",,,
mi_rastrum,SHIP,"Made to follow in the footsteps of the successful of Pala design, the Rastrum-class destroyer was made with larger mining operations in mind. As such it possesses substantially less combat capabilities than main line destroyer designs. But with its drones and overall weapon profile offers itself as a highly effective support vessel.",,,
mi_hammerhead,SHIP,"Metelson Industries has applied minor upgrades to the Hammerhead, subtly enhancing its already formidable endurance in battle and its ballistic strength. These enhancements focus on refining its operational performance and durability, reinforcing its status as a highly respected midline destroyer known for its combat resilience and firepower.",,,

mi_mantarn,SHIP,"The Mantarn-class stands as a defensive stalwart within Metelson Industries' fleet, proving itself robust and evolving into numerous variants. While it may not match the Falcon's speed, its presence is undeniably impressive, especially when the captain fully commits to enhancing its ballistic capabilities with the ship's Sensor Drones. Boasting expansive and overlapping turret arcs, a substantial flux capacity, and an assortment of Ballistic and Composite weapon hardpoints, the Mantarn commands respect.

Initially serving as a platform for weapon testing and a mobile turret array designed for asteroid and particulate demolition, it laid the groundwork for the Ionic Hull Nodes Metelson manufactures today. Equipped with these Ionic-Hull Nodes, the vessel could withstand EMP-intensive encounters, gradually evolving into its current renowned design. Initially, the Ionic Hull Nodes' external placement led to vulnerabilities, particularly to beams and missiles, which could destroy the nodes and potentially trigger a dangerous flux overload, turning several prototypes into wreckage. Implementing a protective covering for the nodes, a flux-management system featuring Dilution Refrigeration for heat control, and additional basic redundancy systems significantly mitigated the risk of flux cascades. Now, such flux overloads are rare, only occurring when all systems and the emergency fail-safe breaker are, against all odds, circumvented.",,,
mi_bigvaringur,SHIP,"The Varangian-class is a straight upgrade upon the the Varingur. While the Varingur is intentded as military cargo vessel the Varangian is a combat carrier that takes the effect of shock and awe and puts it to good use. With belts of armor and a support structure to handle most heavy-loads. This ship is a go-between the Heron and the Mora.

The Varangian-class is an enlarged Varingur frame with many modifications to the basic blueprint. With all of what it has the ship is fairly enimitic regarding it's flux and desgination as a crusier. Likewise, the ship's shield is narrow at 150 degrees, leaving it very exposed when surrounded. The hanger bays are the biggest change. To flight more fighters the hanger bay was obviously widened to allow more fighters to fit into the bay.  Likewise, the ship doesn't have too much of a change in it's cargo, fuel, or crew. This makes it's role as a cargo hauler unlikely and a support ship or two needed for practial combat use.",,,
mi_gadfar,SHIP,"Frequently hailed as a ""System Cruiser,"" the Gadfar-class takes its cues from the Valkyrie blueprint, enhancing it in every aspect. Its title is not simply grandiloquent; many of its crew quarters have been converted into expanded cargo spaces, its arsenal has been upgraded, and its spatial framework has been broadened, transforming the modest Valkyrie-class troop transport destroyer into a coveted cruiser design for cargo transportation and fleet support.

Armed with a comprehensive network of turrets, its principal armaments can focus their firepower directly forward while still providing sufficient coverage on the flanks. Even though its power grid struggles to sustain all of its weapons firing simultaneously over extended periods, it possesses ample firepower to obliterate unsuspecting pirates. Now additionally equipped with an accelerated ammo feeder to enhance its combat efficiency, and safeguarded by dense armor alongside a wide shield arc, the Gadfar is frequently seen as a formidable counterpart to the Apogee-class cruiser.",,,
mi_starliner,SHIP,"
Metelson Industries has masterfully reimagined the Mbaye-Gogol 440 ""Starliner"" into the Stareater-class, transitioning from the epitome of luxury transit to an indispensable asset in salvage and fuel recovery operations. Originally cruising the star systems of the Domain in unparalleled elegance, offering amenities like plush first-class quarters, comprehensive dining options, a zero-gravity entertainment venue, and an exclusive shuttle bay for premier clientele, this vessel has been transformed to meet the practical needs of the Sector's current era.

In its upgraded form, the Stareater relinquishes its passenger-centric features to accommodate advanced salvaging tools and fuel processing units. Despite this shift, it retains its iconic forward shield, now complemented by Metelson's innovative rostor field technology and omni-directional shields, ensuring robust protection against space debris and hostile encounters during recovery missions.

This strategic overhaul, spearheaded by Metelson Industries, has not only equipped the Stareater with sophisticated defensive mechanisms, including enhanced anti-missile flares and reinforced gun turrets but also redefined its mission profile. These modifications serve a dual purpose: safeguarding the vessel's precious cargo of salvage and fuel against piracy and maintaining the Starliner's legacy as a vessel of adaptability and resilience in the face of the galaxy's evolving challenges.",,,
mi_grancursor,SHIP,"The Grancursor-class is essentially an upgrade upon the the Varingur. However in an attempt to move on from older doctrinal designs the Grancursor is larger, better protected and has been shifted more towards the role of a carrier. With a powerful sensor array and luxurious views from its oversized observation windows, the ""Grand Courier"" will take you to the stars in safety and style.

The Grancursor is based upon an enlarged Varingur frame and many other modifications to its blueprint. Unfortunately even with a secondary reactor added to the design it lacks effective power output for front line combat roles and is substantially more sluggish and costly to maintain. Regardless of the shortcomings of the design, it remains an effective and valued support vessel.",,,
mi_cringer,SHIP,"The Cringer stands as a pioneering medium attack cruiser, challenging the esteemed status of the Eagle-class cruiser through a blend of offensive capability and defensive innovation. This vessel, a product of the combined technological advancements of the Pala and the steadfast reliability of the Varingur, distinguishes itself with the integration of a Plasma Burn system, a testament to Metelson R&D's ingenuity. This state-of-the-art propulsion enhancement not only confers superior maneuverability but also enables the Cringer to execute high-speed tactical retreats or advances, setting it apart in the realm of cruiser warfare.

In addition to its remarkable agility, the Cringer is designed with an increased cargo capacity, exceeding that of typical cruisers. This expanded storage capability allows for the transportation of larger quantities of supplies, munitions, and possibly salvage, underscoring the vessel's versatility and operational endurance. Such an attribute ensures that the Cringer can sustain longer missions or support extensive combat operations without the immediate need for resupply.

The armament of the Cringer is further complemented by an extensive array of missile systems, augmenting its already formidable ballistic and point defense (PD) suite. This missile-heavy offense enables the Cringer to engage adversaries with a relentless hail of firepower from a distance, maintaining pressure while leveraging the Plasma Burn system to maneuver into advantageous positions or evade counterattacks effectively.",,,
mi_thrudgelmir,SHIP,"The Thrudgelmir represents the pinnacle of warship design by Metelson Industries, encased in formidable shields and an extensive armor belt for unparalleled defense. It boasts a fearsome arsenal, making it a formidable adversary against any existing class of capital ship.

Equipped with a robust frontal turret array, complemented by sufficient defensive coverage on all sides for point-defense and deterring flanking maneuvers. Enhanced further by a burn drive for rapid tactical positioning, it's allegedly named after a demon from an ancient Earth religion. Whether or not this is factual, its reputation across the Sector as a warship of immense respect is undisputed.",,,
mi_drengur,SHIP,"Building on the ongoing efforts of the Varingur-Class Destroyer and the Gadfar-Class Cruiser, the Drengur-Class Capital-Ship serves as a formidable counterpart to the Odyssey. Crafted with Odyssey schematics, Metelson's design principles, and substantial technological innovations, the Drengur is proficient at deploying a fleet of fighters and managing a minor flotilla under the command of a skilled captain. Nonetheless, while it excels in support capabilities, it faces challenges in maintenance, particularly due to its antiquated fighter bays that launch LPC fighters at a slower pace.",,,
mi_acutor,SHIP,"Engineered to provide auxiliary fire as well as maintenance and support functions, the Acutor-class R&M Hulk stands as an esteemed command ship for numerous small-scale merchant fleet leaders. Yet, akin to the Atlas framework it derives from, it presents a notable vulnerability, missing the requisite shield generator robustness and weaponry to handle engagements with entities larger than a destroyer without backup. Nevertheless, it surpasses the Salvage Rig in terms of both fleet assistance and combat effectiveness, proving to be potentially lethal against any incautious adversary when adeptly maneuvered. Owing to a number of design compromises necessary to incorporate a dry-dock into a combat-support hybrid, it is not equipped to facilitate repairs for frigates and fighters.",,,
#FACTION,,,,,
metelson,FACTION,"Many cycles ago Metelson Industries started as an insignificant operation that specialized in large orders of mining equipment for the highest bidder. However as time passed, profits were increasingly diverted towards research and development, as well as tech mining. Eventually Metelson evolved from simply producing primitive existing technologies for others to creating improvements in armor alloys, laser weapon designs and not long after, designed their first class of vessel based upon discovered blueprints combined with their own ingenuity and experience in manufacturing. No longer would a space miner have to worry about failure of sup-par Mining Pods as Metelson developed a competitive series of mining-oriented equipment and ship classes of their own that were capable of matching or exceeding most existing designs. Word of this soon spread throughout the Sector and Metelson Industries constructed several stations to directly sell their equipment to any captains that possessed the credits, regardless of their affiliations.

Possessing a substantial headquarters on the arid planet of Ragnus which has extensive strip mining operations conducted daily across it. As such the company ostensibly owns the small planet, but in reality it is governed by an independent governmental body.

However in combat the beam loses much of its destructive capabilities that are normally used in mining operations. Despite this, the beam can be powered on briefly during combat to render an enemy vessel castrated with how the beam interacts with hull and shields.",,,
