""Glad to see a friendly face $playerName, what do you need?"" the $personRank absently looks up occasionally from their data pad for the cargo aboard their ship.

""Hey $playerName, what've you been doing out here?"" The $personRank cackles with a good natured smile.

Okay, well, I'll be hanging around the Are-"" the Comm's officer cuts the transmission, ""What the cuss was that?""

""Oh, it's YOU. Hi!"" Sighing with a laugh, the $personRank settles down in their seat after realizing you're not out to kill them (it seems) or someone they have to scan.

The screen is empty, save for a small poster in the background stating ""Hang in there kitty!""  The sound of crew-members shouting and working filter through your speakers. The transmission ends as sensors pick up the flare of engines.

OR
There's a roar of ranting  that comes through the speakers as $personRank $personName rants on about you burning their potatoes. Your comms officer looks at you with a confused cringe before shutting the connection down. This happens just as $personName goes on about how you'll never burn their potatoes without a fight! Some of the crew members laugh as the Comms officer takes a breather.
OR
When you open the link there's a frantic scrambling before a weak voice in the background cries out in a whine, ""Leave us alone!"" there's a sharp pop of static as the transmission is cut.
OR
The $personRank looks at you with a belligerent stare before cutting the link with a slur intended to offend you and your crew. The Comms officer is unphased, they've heard worse from you somedays.
OR
As Comms officer pulls up the connection there's some confusion on their face. The speakers start to blare with the sound of some esoteric, almost primal music, ""We live, we die, we'll live again by Ludd's Luck!"" the music continues before the other ship cuts the connection and waits for your action.
OR
As the $personRank realizes just who you are and the situation. They simply say one word before ending the transmission,  ""Nope."" as the transmission ends their engines come to life to take them away from your fleet.
OR
Looking at you the $personRank Swallows as they finally see you, ""Wisdom is the offspring of suffering and time,"" making a subtle gesture, the video feed is cut, ""And my wisdom tells me it's time to go!"" the fleet then powers up to avoid yours.

With a nervous smile the $personRank speaks quickly, “If our lives are already written, it would take a courageous man to change the script. I am no such man."" $heOrShe cuts the connection, their fleet powering up to run.
OR
""I’m just a simpleton trying to make my way in the universe."" Sighing, the $personRank glowers at you, ""I wanna' go home and drink my mushroom wine, is that too much to ask for?""
OR
Angrily slamming their fists on the console, the $personRank's voice blares through the speaker, ""If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are!""

""Ya' know,"" The $personRank rubs the bridge of their nose, ""In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see."" Looking at you they take another breath and sigh, ""But you are not what I was hoping to see."" ",cutCommLink:Cut the comm link,
