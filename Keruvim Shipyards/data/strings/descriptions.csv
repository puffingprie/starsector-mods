keruvim_cicada,SHIP,"The Cicada bomber wing is a dated design that has been fully replaced by the Silkworm, and is now manufactured for direct marketing to the Independents as part of Keruvim's ""Civilian Export Trade Contract"". Equipped with 2 Hammer torpedoes and a Light Dual Machine Gun, it may look like junk, but if one isn't careful it'll devastate a ship of any size.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_cricket,SHIP,"The Cricket, also known as the MK1 Combat Shuttle, was originally used for transferring crew and cargo between ships, stations and planets. After one was struck by a large asteroid and remained in one piece, Keruvim engineers appreciated it's durability enough to modify the cargo space to fit 2 Gust Cannons and upgraded the engines for combat scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_antlion,SHIP,"Needing a heavy support craft to escort their slower ships, Keruvim engineers put together the Antlion assault fighter. Armed with 2 Needle Beams and an Ion Cannon, Antlions are very effective at dealing with other fighters and harassing larger targets, but they lack the raw firepower to do any significant damage.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_flea,SHIP,"Based on the Borer, Fleas are as light and cheap as they come, and as a consequence are locked to their host ship. Nonetheless, Fleas are good point defense drones and missile deterrents, and are widely used by Keruvim.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_beetle,SHIP,The Beetle defense drone was made specifically for manufacture in the reused Mothership forge bays left behind in the Lucerne's construction.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_silkworm,SHIP,"A fairly modern addition to Keruvim's forces that was developed after one too many Cicadas got quickly intercepted by frigates, the Silkworm is a much faster light bomber wing, designed for support during hit-and-run missions. It is equipped with 2 Starburst MRMs.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_spider,SHIP,"Bringing 4 weapons to bear, the aptly named Spider is Keruvim's most advanced fighter craft. Built specially for fighter superiority, it can quickly deal with anything but the most overwhelming odds, and is particularly popular among captains for how effectively it can overwhelm Pirate vessels.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_talon,SHIP,"Fast and cheap, the Talon sports surprising firepower and is capable of dispatching enemy fighters. It can also deal appreciable damage to larger ships when used en masse, though such use usually results in heavy pilot losses.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_piranha,SHIP,"The Piranha deploys unpowered conventional bombs en masse, relying on momentum to deliver the payloads. The maximum damage potential is extreme, but most targets can either avoid or shoot down many of the bombs.",,,,,,,,,,,
broadsword,SHIP,"Tough and agile, the Broadsword carries a decoy flare launcher that draws defensive fire away from high-value targets like bombers and their payloads. However, it can falter if faced with the need to deal the killing blow itself.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_bouncer,SHIP,"Made up of Dominator parts with some creative freedom mixed into the formula, the Bouncer is an ugly ship. As unsightly as it is, it can be quite effective, due to a strong superstructure and impressive weapon package.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_flamberge,SHIP,"Built for speed and lacking in just about every other field, the Flamberge's fixed weapons facing in only one direction, along with its lack of armor restricts it to primarily frontal engagements, and it is easily taken down by most fighters.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_cerberus,SHIP,A heavy modification to the base Cerberus which adds heavier armor while removing much of its cargo space for a small flight deck to supplement its firepower. One of few Pirate Inc. modifications that made sense.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_lasher,SHIP,"The expert engineers at Pirate Inc. had to reason to ""fix"" the already powerful Lasher, With no direct changes to its weapon loadout and only minor armor and engine tweaks one has to wonder if it was even worth the effort and credits to modify so many Lashers.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_cutlass,SHIP,"The Cutlass at a glance is simply two Omens welded together, Though while that is true what lays beneath is a purpose built assault frigate able to quickly and brutally take down its targets and move on to the next without breaking a sweat. While its shield is far less effective then the original Omen, the Cutlass makes up for it with its improved hull, armor and an additional turret. The most advanced ship modified by Pirate Inc. and beloved by any Pirate who gets to captain such a vessel (What few don't explode at launch)",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_axe_a,SHIP,"The original variant of the Axe is configured for ultra light carrier duty, allowing smaller fleets to support fighters without proper carriers slowing them down, though it is highly vulnerable to other fighters and light frigates, so it is recommended to keep them close to other combat ships for safety.

The Axe is the 2nd ship class to enter Keruvim's new generation of modular ship designs, being light and nimble allows these vessels to be perfect for scouting and harassment duties regardless of configuration. But, the Axe is somewhat lacking when brought into heavy fighting without proper support",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_axe_lgbt,SHIP,"The original variant of the Axe is configured for ultra light carrier duty, allowing smaller fleets to support fighters without proper carriers slowing them down, though it is highly vulnerable to other fighters and light frigates, so it is recommended to keep them close to other combat ships for safety.

But, the Axe is somewhat lacking when brought into heavy fighting without proper support",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_axe_b,SHIP,"The MK.II variant of the Axe is configured for light combat/escort duty, its fragile nature means it is ill-suited for direct combat with heavy military frigates without supporting craft, so it is recommended to keep them close to other combat ships for safety.

The Axe is the 2nd ship class to enter Keruvim's new generation of modular ship designs, being light and nimble allows these vessels to be perfect for scouting and harassment duties regardless of configuration. But, the Axe is somewhat lacking when brought into heavy fighting without proper support",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_shotel,SHIP,"The Shotel-class attack frigate is one of few Keruvim non-carrier military ships. It sacrifices versatility (and point defense) for pure attack power. Alternatively, it can be made into a reliable escort ship if one puts only point defense weapons on its energy mounts.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_shotel_lgbt,SHIP,"The Shotel-class attack frigate is one of few Keruvim non-carrier military ships. It sacrifices versatility (and point defense) for pure attack power. Alternatively, it can be made into a reliable escort ship if one puts only point defense weapons on its energy mounts.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_condor,SHIP,"This Condor modifaction is yet another pointless up-armored waste of resorces often found in Pirate fleets designed by the egg heads at Pirate Inc. for 1 purpuse, unfortitally that purpuse has yet to be determend... Nonetheless this vessel is still space worthy and still finds itself in many Pirate fleets.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_zweihander_b,SHIP,"The MK.II variant of the Zweihander is one of Keruvim's most popular ships thanks to its ability to fill both the roles of assault destroyer and light carrier at once. While most dedicated combat destroyers may outmatch it, its still more then capable of holding its own.

The 1st ship to be produced for Keruvim's new generation of modular ship designs, and easily the most iconic of them, the Zweihander is a front-line support and assault ship often seen leading the charge thanks to its Angel Drive Boosters. One of few Keruvim ships capable of operating effectively without support, despite this many captains use this vessel as a spearhead for attack groups, or to fill holes in the front-line.

",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_culverin,SHIP,"The Culverin is small and fragile for its class, but it more then makes up for it with its ability to launch an unmatched payload. It's a perfect vessel for any captain looking to add heavy missile support to their fleet.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_culverin_t,SHIP,"The Culverin is small and fragile for its class, but it more then makes up for it with its ability to launch an unmatched payload. It's a perfect vessel for any captain looking to add heavy missile support to their fleet.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_mule,SHIP,"The Pirate Inc. Mule is a powerful combat destroyer built around the ever popular Mule, its weapon package was deemed insufficient for some reason by Pirate Inc. they sacrificed cargo space room was made for added engine power and a small nanoforge, which was subsequently welded open and changed into an impromptu flight deck. For better or worse, a Talon LPC was permanently installed into the forge, giving this Mule more bite than its size would suggest. Thanks to this, it is now a common sight in Pirate raid groups.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_buccaneer,SHIP,"The shipwrights at Pirate Inc. noticed no one was taking advantage of the large amount of Gemini frieghters collecting dust, and decided to do what they do best: install over-sized fighter bays and overpowered engines operating well beyond safety limits. That and a fragile hull make the Buccaneer the ""perfect"" carrier for any pirate in need of disposable fighter wings to chase down merchants attempting to flee.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_carrion,SHIP,"Seeing the Salvage Rig as dead weight outside of its niche field, Keruvim decided to scrap all of its rigs and use the parts for proper spacefaring vessels. The Carrion, while more expensive than the ubiquitous Salvage Rig, is a step above for any captain who wants more from their ships. The Carrion is also able to hold its own in a fight due to its 3 drone bays, at the cost of cargo space.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_keg,SHIP,"The Mule's tanker cousin. Built to withstand the horrors of day to day life in space and fight back, the Keg is a must-have for upstart captains looking to keep thier assets safe from pirates.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_mortar,SHIP,"The Mortar is a long range artillery platform built to allow quicker fleets to take down larger ships without much trouble. Its lack of speed means it will often stay back with the fleet's carriers, but the Mortar maintains a decent weapons package, allowing it to go toe-to-toe with other ships of it size. As with most Keruvim ships, it is unwise to leave a Mortar without proper support, as it can be easily overwhelmed.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_rapier,SHIP,"The Rapier is a fast Pather assault vessel made from the central section of a Dominator, and strangely enough, armor plating from a Prometheus tanker. The usage of capital grade (albeit civilian) armor, makes this a fairly solid ship for it’s size and speed.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_hammerhead,SHIP,"This Pirate Inc. Hammerhead moves the base ships bridge back, replaces the small missile mounts with a medium, its useless energy mounts for ballistics and reinforces the ships spine and engines with additional armor plating.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_dominator,SHIP,"Pirate Inc. had no need of a super heavy dedicated carrier, But nonetheless this prompted them to take drastic and unnecessary measures to modify countless Dominator Cruisers into what is now one of the deadliest and unwieldy ships in the sector.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_ranger,SHIP,"The Ranger is far more dangerous than its appearance would suggest. Due to it looking like it was converted for cargo hauling, many captains that face this ship don't view it as a threat and largely ignore it during battle, only to find it slowly slugging through the fight, tearing to pieces any frigate or destroyer that approaches with its hive of mining drones within its hull and massive mining laser fused to the ship.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_cudgel,SHIP,"A mainline cruiser designed by Pirates Inc. for engaging multiple targets at once thanks to its duel broadside weapon placements. While this is effective against smaller targets, the Cudgel falls short vs ships of its size and it should be given proper support before attempting such engagements. ",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_chariot_a,SHIP,"The Chariot Quadriga is the best carrier Keruvim fields pound for pound, bringing 4 flight decks to bear (albeit restricted ones) as-well as decent turret coverage to fend off missiles and fighters, though anything more will surely overtake this sluggish beast.

The 3rd ship to come from Keruvim's new generation of modular ship designs, The Chariot series of carriers provide heavy fighter support regardless of configuration, allowing any fleet to overwhelm its enemies quickly and efficiently at range, but the carriers are quite slow and thus vulnerable to lighter craft, so it is recommended to keep these vessels close to other combat ships.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_chariot_b,SHIP,"The Chariot Triga is an experiment on possible cruiser sized battle-carriers for more intense combat situations, bringing 3 flight decks and 1 large mount to bear as-well as decent turret coverage to fend off missiles and fighters. While the test was considered a failure, the Triga is still kept in service due to reliability, but a 3rd Chariot variant will surely be brought into service soon.

keruvim_glaive,SHIP,"One of the few dedicated combat cruisers used by Keruvim, the Glaive is made to hold the line and protect carriers while the fleet's fighters whittle down the enemy ships. Unable to directly take on other warships of its class due to its low flux pool, Glaives are much better suited to deal with multiple smaller targets at once, and are dedicated frigate-killers.

",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_brute,SHIP,"The Brute, given the designation of heavy cruiser, is actually an amalgamation of several ships fused together in pirate drydocks in order to go toe-to-toe with other ships of its size. Due to its origin, the Brute has quite an impressive weapon array, but it suffers from an abysmal reactor output and the hull lacking a proper superstructure, making it quite fragile for a cruiser.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_catapult,SHIP,"The Catapult is an inefficient and clunky missile cruiser made shortly after the Onslaught-Class Battleships were first launched into service, Large enough that it is barely considered a cruiser and a speed (or lack-there-of) that would make any captain lose their patience if not for the ships burn-drive make it an acquired taste.

Keruvim Shipyards made it clear it was inspired by and meant to serve beside the Onslaught-Class, while it caught the attention of the Domain they ultimately turned it down, but took enough interest in the company to put Keruvim on the map. The Catapult was brought make into service by keruvim and sold to any willing buyers as they knew sturdy and dependable ships are in high demand since the collapse due to the volatile nature of the modern sector.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_morgenstern,SHIP,A modern design brought to fruition when Keruvim realized that their cruiser's where far to sluggish to outmaneuver sleeker designs as the Angel Wing Boosters only help when chasing targets directly in-front of them. So the Morgenstern was made using design elements from the Zweihander and Chariots to make a quick and agile cruiser purpose built to hunt frigates and destroyers then provide fire-support against larger targets.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_stallion,SHIP,"One of few military grade freighters made by Keruvim, The Stallion was made originally made to show the potential of mostly automated cargo ships and was intended as just a proof of concept turned into a mainline vessel in most keruvim fleets for its usefulness on and off the battlefield.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_flail,SHIP,An incredibly light frigate purpose built to chase down frigates and damaged destroyers. The Flail brings high fire power for its size but in-turn has a very fragile frame and should be handled with caution.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_paragon_p,SHIP,"While most pirates in possession of this behemoth would boast that it was a prize taken from glorious battle, the truth is more likely to be that it was stolen from a corporate scrapheap.

The Paragon is widely believed to be the pinnacle of domain technology, requiring careful engineering and science just to start the engines. The Pirates, however, lack the patience and subtlety and have jury rigged this Paragon using parts from other ships in order to overcome their limitations.

Though inferior to the genuine article, the Pirate Paragon has proven time and time again that is a genuine threat to any space fairing vessel.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_bastion,SHIP,"Built around Empress battle-carriers that were deemed too damaged for active duty, this fine vessel comes with a full suite of salvage equipment, surveying sensors and more than enough storage to help support a small fleet. While the Bastion is a capable warship, able to fend off the common pirates of the sector, it is still outperformed by more specialized capital ships, and should not engage in combat without support.  

The crew quarters on the Bastion are a true luxury, with the comfortable furniture and the fine foods onboard, one would forget this is a salvage platform if it was not for the loud sounds of machinery heard around every corner.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_outlaw,SHIP,"Designed by the group known as the ""Pirate Inc."", the Outlaw-class battleship is a terrifying and dismal sight for any who face it, made up mostly of destroyed, low-tech warships. A jack-of-all-trades on the battlefield, the Outlaw is capable of devastating any ship dumb enough take it head on and boasts two flight decks to supplement its ample firepower. Despite its scrappy origins these are among the most capable warships ships in the sector.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_lucerne,SHIP,"The Lucerne’s name says it all, this ship is designed to hit as hard as possible and break anything that goes against it. By splicing together pieces of an Atlas, a destroyed Domain Explorarium Mother-ship, and a strange corrupted blueprint found on a crashed Cryosleeper, some unknown engineers have made a true warship that few others can match. By using the Explorarium AI Systems still in the ship, this capital-class ship requires only a destroyer's crew complement to operate.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_duchess,SHIP,"The Duchess is one of the quickest capital ships in the sector, able to outrun most cruisers and some destroyers, though is its unable to retreat effectively without support due to its poor turn-speed and rear thrust. While this often makes most captains think twice before using it, its raw frontal firepower and high missile potential often seal the deal. Though one must be careful with the Duchess, she is quite fragile and is easily outflanked by smaller and more maneuverable ships, unlike her sister ship the Empress.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_empress,SHIP,"What seems like an attempt at designing a modern version of the Legion-Class was merely just a side effect of the Empress's true nature, a mobile invasion and siege platform. Originally commissioned by the Domain to oversee hostile takeovers of rebelling worlds too importent to burn down with just drone ships, the Empress's ability to effectively assist in both space and ground warfare made it a popular command ship for Domain captains even after the collapse, who used its armaments to enforce security and keep the peace.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_quarry,SHIP,"This Atlas was refitted by Keruvim for large scale mining operations. Removal of the cargo holds, upgrades to the shields and flux reactor to keep it protected within asteroid fields, and heavy-duty armor plating like that of the Venture Class makes this ship dangerous in combat, though under-armed for its size.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_cracker,WEAPON,An old but powerful mining laser originally used for digging into massive asteriods and dead planets. Captains of the Ranger quickly discovered its incredible usefulness in attacking large spacecraft.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_m21,WEAPON,"The M21 Light Blaster started it's life as a hull breaker on a salvage rig, and much to no one's surprise it's still used for that exact purpose, if a bit more violent.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_star_single,WEAPON,"Made to be a versatile option compared to standard MRMs, The Starburst is a support missile that sacrifices its explosive payload for a decent energy and EMP burst upon impact.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_star_pod,WEAPON,"Made to be a versatile option compared to standard MRMs, The Starburst is a support missile that sacrifices its explosive payload for a decent energy and EMP burst upon impact.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_star,WEAPON,"Made to be a versatile option compared to standard MRMs, The Starburst is a support missile that sacrifices its explosive payload for a decent energy and EMP burst upon impact.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_blast_gun,WEAPON,"The Blast Gun was first made by a pirate who didn't have access to any functional high explosive weapons and converted several heavy auto-cannons to suit her needs. Now working for Keruvim after a change of heart, she gave them the design, and now they happily field it in almost every fleet.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_needle,WEAPON,The Needle Beam is a slow but heavy burst laser that tears through fighters and missiles with brutal efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_tsar,WEAPON,"The heaviest weapon ever made by Keruvim, the Tsar Cannon was built from a corrupted blueprint chip found on a derelict Explorarium Mothership during a routine salvage mission, which was hacked to bring it to a usable state. While some of its power was sacrificed to make it work for modular use, the Tsar Cannon still maintained its deadly nature, and can now be seen on Keruvims's biggest warships. ",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_gust,WEAPON,"An alternative to the Light Assault Gun, the Gust Cannon is slow firing but brings a bit more bang per round for use against bigger targets",,,,,,,,,,,

keruvim_wing,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_ammo,SHIP_SYSTEM,Activates a jamming-prone mechanism for quickly delivering ammo to the ship's ballistic weapon emplacements. The mechanism must be re-calibrated and cooled before it can be used again.,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim_fury,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Temporarily activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage and engages a primary burn on the system travel drive of the ship, providing a massive speed boost.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keruvim,FACTION,"Keruvim Shipyards were a once prominent construction company contracted by the Domain of Man before the collapse, building new and advanced ships for every walk of life and often butting heads with the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Keruvim specialized in Midline warships and rose to power shortly after it became obvious that fighter-craft are the future of warfare, thus prompting Keruvim to start producing new and experimental battle-carriers able to be equipped for any situation.

After the collapse, Keruvim went into hiding in hopes of avoiding the ensuing chaos and keeping their planets stable. While it initially worked, it quickly became apparent that while Keruvim is near unmatched in ship design, they are lacking in governmental skills and are incapable of ruling over their worlds. Realizing this and not wanting the growing unrest to get out of hand, they decided change was in order, commanding their worlds to each pick 2 representatives to form a ruling council and oversee their future. To ensure peace would remain, Keruvim would stay as their de-facto rulers but would stay on the sidelines (maybe ""continue to be passive""?) and focus on security and construction needs.

It was only until after the 2nd AI War ended that Keruvim revealed themselves to the rest of the Core-Worlds. Seeing that the Core needed a factor of stabilization now more then ever, and seeing limitless demand for new ships and countless scrap to be recycled into new parts, Keruvim decided to start a new generation of modular ship parts allowing them to quickly assemble ship after ship on the fly without dedicated shipyards. This can already be seen on most of their modern vessels, as they contain dozens of repeating and recognizable parts inside and out.",,,,,,,,,,,

anvil_pengar,CUSTOM,Penger is a highly prized planet entirely covered in fresh water and is one of the main food suppliers for Keruvim Shipyards,,,,,,,,,,,
anvil_jord,CUSTOM,"Jord is lightly populated to keep its environment clean, and mining operations are kept to a minimum to maintain optimal farming conditions, as Keruvim does not wish to ruin one of the few habitable planets left in the sector.",,,,,,,,,,,
anvil_crucible,CUSTOM,"A covering of old patchwork shipyards, mines, and factories makes it obvious that Crucible was once the capital of an unknown post-collapse ship manufacturer. Nothing remains that could identify who the planet's owners once were, other then a few faded blue logos containing an anvil. Rumor says that the population was slaughtered by the highly militarized group known as ""Pirate Inc."" some cycles ago. Large cities appear to have been partially built underground to help combat the cold, and make it more livable for the population of this fallen industrial powerhouse as the old shipyards of this world still churn out advanced ships for pirate use.. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.",,,,,,,,,,,
anvil_enfer,CUSTOM,"Taken from the Pirates shortly after Keruvim revealed themselves to the Core-Worlds, Enfer is a hellish planet covered in volcanoes and ore-rich oceans of lava. While Keruvim prefers to avoid putting their people in such dangerous conditions, their growing need for metals has not given them much choice. However, every precaution possible is taken to ensure there are minimal casualties during operations here.",,,,,,,,,,,
anvil_amor,CUSTOM,"Amor is a highly Toxic and ore-rich planet ignored by all major mining companies before the collapse due to the extreme hazards it possessed. Keruvim, seeing this as a challenge began building massive orbital superstructures to plunge deep into this poisoned planet's crust to begin ore extraction. Seeing no end to the flow of raw metals coming from Amor, they decided to build large city centers around the mining platforms, eventually leading to factories, then entire shipyards. Today Amor the ever-thriving Capital of Keruvim Shipyards has been nicknamed the ""Heart of Industry""",,,,,,,,,,,
anvil_afecto,CUSTOM,"A small colony once belonging to Tri-Tach that joined Keruvim shortly after they were deemed ""not worth the resources"" by the tech-corp during the collapse. While not exactly a paradise by any sense of the word, it maintains a breathable atmosphere and has an adequate supply of ore.",,,,,,,,,,,
