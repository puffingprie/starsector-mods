expsp_salient,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Seemingly created from a mix of Sentry and Defender components, the Salient is a nonstandard design not found in Domain databases. Agile, well armored, and armed to the teeth, this machine poses a far greater threat than standard models. Can overclock its weapon systems for a brief burst of increased firepower.",,,
expsp_salient_redcomet,SHIP,"Rumors speak of how an unknown pilot salvaged a Salient drone frigate, tore out its internals to make way for a cockpit, then proceeded to fill it with a physics-defying amount of high-tech components of mysterious origin. Outperforms the original by a factor of 3 in most aspects.",,,
expsp_fascine,SHIP,"Tough, moderately armed fighter used by the drone warships of the Domain. It can temporarily overclock its ballistic weapon systems to deal surprising amounts of damage.",,,
expsp_defilade,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

Sister ship to the Salient, the Defilade bolsters lighter Domain combat drones with fighter support. To this end, it carries a small bay with a wing of Fascine drones, while still maintaining a reasonable amount of firepower and its sister's ammo feeder system.",,,
expsp_hetzer,SHIP,"Agile destroyer used by MVS. Often found in patrols, providing support with its excellent sensors and EW equipment.  Its built in manuvering jets allow the ship to easily escape dangerous situations or chase down fleeing hostiles. Carries a pair of built-in SRM pods to keep enemy shields up. Carries a wing of Attack Funnels for defense against missiles and fighters.",,,

expsp_eaglemvs,SHIP,"MVS retrofit of the classic Eagle cruiser. An upgraded flux core allows for better general performance, more versatile mounts allow for even more loadout flexibility, and an Attack Funnel wing helps mitigate the standard Eagle's weakness to fighters.  These improvements, however, have made the ship significantly more costly to deploy in battle.",,,
expsp_kurierin,SHIP,"Reliable and durable, capable of warding off light pirate threats. Carries more armor, built in missiles, and a pair of support drones, but less loadout versatility and cargo space compared to its competitor, the Wayfarer.",,,
expsp_cipher,SHIP,"First MVS phase vessel to see mass production. Its proprietary angular phase field generator is much more robust than standard phase coils, allowing for increased operating time, but sacrifices flux efficiency.  Heavy armor and a generous amount of hull integrity alongside an array of point defense mounts gives it decent survivability even when caught unphased, and its Burst Core system allows it to unleash a torrent of firepower before going back into P-space.",,,
expsp_dragonhunter,SHIP,"Further retrofit of the Conquest (MVS), equipped with a spinally-mounted superheavy railgun. Initially created as a test platform for MVS heavy weapons. The current current iteration of the design carries the Lightning Spear railgun, capable of disabling enemy vessels from a distance while still dealing respectable damage.  Four of its weapon mounts have been replaced with flux capacitors, vents, and secondary shield generators, increasing its flux capabilities and greatly improving its shields. The remaining heavy mounts have been re-oriented to face forwards, allowing the ship to focus its arsenal on a single target. The resulting ship is suited for long-range bombardment of targets, while still maintaining the ability to quickly engage and disengage. The class gained its name after a test unit was able to slay a pirate warlord known as the ""Dragon King"" with a well-placed shot to his flagship's bridge.",,,
expsp_intervention,SHIP,"Specialized MVS support destroyer. The vessel is built around the Eisenfaust-class superheavy railgun, giving it incredible firepower at long ranges. Armed with a respectable complement of weapons alongside its primary armament. A wing of Attack Funnels provide PD support, and a pair of built-in Poke SRMS distracts enemy point defense systems. However, these features come with the logistical costs of a cruiser. Ocasionally, MVS operatives piloting the Intervention fire its main gun while charging an enemy, reminicent of lance charges used by the knights of ancient Earth.",,,
expsp_anker,SHIP,"An antique design from MVS's early days, retrofitted numerous times over the cycles to create a formidable line cruiser. Originally created to be idiotproof as possible to compensate for any defects caused by haphazard construction, the design proved to be even more effective when pristine. Its original name has been lost to time, perhaps deliberately forgotten or erased to aid with the rebuilding of the faction's reputation. Regardless of its past, the current iteration of this design is a mainstay of task forces and invasion fleets, capable of delivering a withering hail of fire to the battlefield while shrugging off all but the most devastating attacks with its unyielding armor. Its captains are known to be extremely stubborn, refusing to retreat even when their vessel has entire hull sections blasted off. ",,,
expsp_kriegsmesser,SHIP,"Standard MVS frigate. Survivable, agile, but somewhat lightly armed, though it makes up for this through loadout versatility. Carries the signature MVS combination of an Attack Funnel drone and a pair of Mini Poke SRMs as standard. Decent flux, shields, and armor, along with manuvering jets for escaping make this vessel relatively forgiving for rookie pilots. Forms the backbone of MVS patrols. ",,,
expsp_cainhurst,SHIP,"The pride of Mischmetal's fleets, the Cainhurst was the first domestically-designed capital vessel created by MVS, shortly after the Collapse. Originally resembling the venerable Onslaught, the Cainhurst now is far more visually distinct, only sharing the dual built-in energy pulse weapons of it ancestor. Aggressive and maneuverable, the Cainhurst can both trade blows with other battleships and battlecruisers and hunt down cruisers. Its unique Core Overclock has become a key part of its identity, making the ship more deadly and maneuverable but comes at the cost of increasing stress on delicate systems. Over the cycles, the sight of crimson engine plumes has become the stuff of nightmares to Pirate captains.",,,
,,"Originally designed using Onslaught parts, the Cainhurst-class has seen its share of upgrading over the years. Its name changed during MVS's reputation, the Cainhurst has more or less thrown off its old reputation of a pale simulacra of the ship somewhat resembles. Other than the radically different frame, the most prominent of its changes are the vastly different weapon mounts, allowing for superior weapon convergence at the cost of potential firepower and the inclusion of an improved flux core, making it more competetive in the modern battlefield. The crude Burn Drive has been swapped out for a more elegant Plasma Jets system, allowing the ship to achieve impressive feats of agility for its size.",,,
expsp_provisioner,SHIP,"Standard MVS logistics vessel. Heavily armed and armored for a freighter, but lacks a powerful flux core. Its robust point defense systems and support drones allow it to usually escape a battle unscathed. Although its accomodations are spartan and the duty not quite as glorious as being part of a combat ship's crew, MVS operatives assigned to these vessels take quiet pride in knowing that they are the main reason the dedicated combat ships can effectively operate and win battles.",,,
expsp_forager,SHIP,"Light salvage and exploration frigate manufactured by Machina Void Services. Considered an upgrade to the more common Shepherd, having more armor and hull integrity. However, the most important upgrade is the wing of Type 31 Mining Drones it carries, which pack far more firepower than standard Borer drones. ",,,
expsp_virtue,SHIP,"At first glance, the Virtue-class light combat carrier appears to be a heavily modified Condor. Indeed, the Virtue is cousin to the common Condor-class carrier, both originating from the Tarsus hull. However, unlike the Condor, the Virtue is intended to launch its fighters close to the front lines. Heavily armored and equipped with a significant defensive arsenal, this carrier is far from a sitting duck when found without an escort.",,,
expsp_glance,SHIP,"Machina Void Shipyards' cheapest fighter offering, the Glance-class interceptor drone is essentially a Coil CIWS bolted onto a small frame with engines attached. Cheap, expendable, and surprisingly tough for its size and cost. Excellent distraction to allow more important craft to attack uninterrupted. Can deal surprising amounts of damage to exposed hull.",,,
expsp_eviscerate,SHIP,"The Eviscerate-class drone is a dedicated strike craft hunter, equipped with a devastating close-range arsenal. Despite its Delta-class onboard AI falling well within Hegemony AI restrictions, MVS carrier captains commanding them swear the machines take sadistic glee in ruthlessly tearing apart lightly armored bombers with an avalanche of Coil CIWS and Particle Scatterblaster fire.",,,
expsp_principality,SHIP,Cruiser-sized battlecarrier based on an Lazarus hull. Sacrifices many of its sister's modular weapon slots for a hangar and an integrated rapid-fire Scepter Siege Cannon. Its heavy armor and still reasonable armament allow it to fight alongside dedicated frontline vessels. Perhaps the class's most interesting feature is its Crown of Authority  system that siphons flux to temporarily boost its shield efficiency. ,,,
expsp_kris,SHIP,Lightest FTL-equipped vessel available to the MVS navy. A pair of extended range Coil CIWS units supplement an otherwise anemic armament. Extreme speed and relatively decent survivability allows the vessel to perform well as a dedicated harassment craft. Commonly found in MVS patrols.,,,

expsp_searchlight,SHIP,"Cruiser reverse-engineered from drone warships used during the AI War. Equipped with the efficient Beacon Suppression Laser where a second large mount would be, giving it a reliable weapon for use in various situations. Good armor and decent shields provide fair survivability. Its unique system allows it to deal massive damage depending on loadout.",,,
expsp_pierce,SHIP,"Standard MVS heavy drone fighter. Heavily armed and armored, and carries flares, much like its more common counterpart, the Broadsword. Unlike the Broadsword, however, the Pierce carries a version of the Jab Rocket Launcher with light tracking capabilities, along with a slower-firing Armorhunter Light Autocannon, giving it great effectiveness against heavy craft.",,,
expsp_shashka,SHIP,"The Shashka represents the peak of MVS engineering, possessing great firepower, mobility, and survivability.  Its ability to temporarily disable its performance limiters allows the vessel to chase down enemy frigates and tear them apart with increased firepower. With its unmatched offensive capability, the Shashka can make short work of almost any other frigate in the Sector, and hold its own against light destroyers like the Shrike, though it struggles against full-sized destroyers. Beloved by MVS aces and fleet commanders alike, serving well as both a duelist and a wolfpack skirmisher.",,,
expsp_borermvs,SHIP,"Light mining drone used by MVS civilian ships. Well armored and heavily armed for its size, it can serve as an effective deterrent to enemy fighters, especially the Talon interceptor widespread among the Sector's lawless factions.",,,
expsp_verteidiger,SHIP,"Standard MVS heavy destroyer. Heavily armored and well-armed. Its Bombardment Mode system allows it to serve well as a fleet anchor or a line ship, making it a staple of MVS fleets. Its robust PD system supplemented by a pair of Attack Funnels allows it to deter fighters and heat-seeking missiles, including the common Salamander. An unique weapon, the Quicksilver Blaster, allows it to finish off crippled enemies. Thanks to these traits, the Dismas has a reputation for excellent combat endurance.",,,
expsp_malakh,SHIP,"Seen as a marvel of engineering by some, the Malakh is one of few frigate-sized ships to mount a full fighter bay without any crippling drawbacks. Reasonably armed, armored, and fairly mobile, the Malakh is designed to complement the Kampfmesser-class frigate, and is often found in patrol fleets, providing valuable support with its interceptors.",,,
expsp_slash,SHIP,"Sister design to the Glance, the Lacerate drone interceptor is built around a Las-Repeater instead of the Glance's Coil CIWS, with a secondary Vulcan cannon. Sacrifices hull integrity for resistance to EMP damage and firepower. Synergizes well with the Glance, with the Lacerates cutting through armor after the Glances take down the enemy's shields.",,,
expsp_incise,SHIP,"One of the few manned MVS fighter craft designs still in service, the Incise is based off an old Terran design with major upgrades. Armed with a pair of anti-fighter missile pods and a trio of coil weapons, the Incise performs well against both shields and armor. Mainly used for reserve forces or exported to the defense fleets of Independent polities, but still popular among particularly stubborn old aces.",,,
expsp_pummel,SHIP,"Based off of a truly ancient bomber design, albeit automated and upgraded, the Pummel refuses to be phased out. Its current iteration carries a pair of miniature SRM pods and a pair of cruise missiles, making it an appreciable long-ranged strike craft. Carries a XF-850D drone for self-defense.",,,
expsp_xf850d,SHIP,Tiny automated fighter equipped with a pair of compact Coil CIWS weapons. Often integrated into a ship's nanoforge systems. ,,,
expsp_falcon_mvs_ew,SHIP,"MVS retrofit of the famous Falcon-class light cruiser. A dedicated electronic warfare suite mounted in the ship's trench allows it to bolster friendly weapons systems and give friendlies navigation data as well as provide ECM and ECCM support. These upgrades, however, make it as expensive as an Eagle to maintain and deploy.",,,
expsp_raze,SHIP,"The Raze-class Variable Fighter Drone is a newer post-Collapse model, built for serving numerous roles at once. Most notably, it has a pair of piston-driven legs instead of landing gear, allowing it to serve as an impromptu mech, making it invaluable in raids and boarding operations. Its pair of powerful Pulsar Burst Lasers provide excellent firepower, capable of punching through even destroyer-grade ship armor. Deadly against frigates or destroyers with weak PD.",,,
expsp_whack,SHIP,"An unconventional dual-fuselage drone fighter initially created from the wreckage of recovered enemy fighter craft, now standardized into a LPC. Ungainly, unshielded, and presents a large target for AA weaponry. However, its saving grace is the firepower of the oversized but fully functionial high-caliber cannon mounted between its twin fuselages. Devastating against unshielded targets, but relies on escorts to get into range.",,,
expsp_asdf1,SHIP,"The ASDF-03 is a highly advanced manned fighter fielded by the elite units of Mischmetal's fleets. Heavily armed, survivable, and relatively fast, it can tackle either larger vessels or enemy fighter craft wings. Its advanced Inertia Override system means it can turn on a dime, increasing its ability to remain on target. Expensive but deadly, capable of singlehandedly tearing apart enemy frigates.",,,
expsp_scytale,SHIP,"An unusual hybrid of phase cloak and shield technology, the Scytale is one of the most unusual frigates to see regular use in the Sector. It mounts both a low-grade shield emitter as well a phase cloak that activates in short bursts. Its combination of a shield and heavy armor make it much more survivable than a standard phase frigate. However, its complex construction makes it more expensive to maintain.",,,
expsp_kiel,SHIP,"Light-cruiser conversion of the famous Apogee-class exploration cruiser. Although slightly slow compared to its peers the Fury and the Falcon, it retains some of its progenitor's survivability. Often used to break through enemy lines or conduct flanking maneuvers, serving as the hammer to the anvil that is the Lazarus-Class Heavy Cruiser",,,
expsp_backstab,SHIP,"Advanced strike craft used by MVS forces. Its most prominent trait is the phase system embedded in its hull. Its ""Phase Lines"" are cost-effective and efficient, but emit a level of exotic radiation deadly for human pilots, an issue exacerbated by the lack of space in the craft to mount shielding. In order to counteract this issue, a simple automated control chip is mounted in a human pilot's place, though even such a device is eventually damaged beyond repair after a few sorties. Despite these issues, it is liked by crew and ship commanders alike, thanks to its ability to reliably deliver high-powered ordnance without getting hit.",,,
expsp_hound_drone_mvs,SHIP,"Automated refit of the common Hound freighter. Equipped with a Silence Hybrid Blaster and a Plasma Burn system, making it an effective strike corvette.",,,
expsp_jas39x,SHIP,"Standard automated light MVS fighter. Its Delta-class AI, although simple, has been optimized by cycles of continued use, leading to highly efficiency. Its reactor core can temporarily overclock, granting a boost in maneuverability that can allow a fighter to quickly change direction to evade or pursue enemies. Lacks missiles, but a pair of fragmentation grenade launchers allows each fighter to cover a zone with a maelstrom of razor-sharp fragments, shredding enemy ordnance and fighters into scrap.",,,
expsp_crusaderv,SHIP,"Manned fighter design that hails from a long lineage of aerospace fighters armed primarily with a quartet of autocannons. Unshielded, but capable of tearing through all but the most heavily armored enemy fighters and frigates.",,,
expsp_kiteskipper,SHIP,"A post-Collapse ""chipbash"" of the Kite and the Mudskipper shuttles, the Switchblade would have caused much legal trouble if the creators of the two original vessels were in any shape to complain. Fast and survivable, the Switchblade is let down only by its lack of modular weapons. However, its built-in Kamikaze Shuttle Launcher somewhat alleviates this issue. Often used as a miniature troop transport thanks to its large personnel capacity and specialized equipment for ground operations. However, its true specialty is as a raiding vessel, capable of chasing down and destroying enemy freighters, allowing for MVS forces to recover stolen goods from pirate convoys.",,,
expsp_sammlerin,SHIP,"Common MVS civilian vessel created from various common blueprints. Rugged and reliable, the Piran is loved by its crews as not only a capable mining ship, but a salvager, a light freighter, and all too often in the chaotic Persean Sector, a decent makeshift combat vessel. Although lacking in direct firepower and mobility, the Piran makes up for it with its survivability, versatility, and a swarm of heavily-armed mining drones. In fact, the Piran has been used so often in defensive operations against pirates and as a convoy escort that new hulls now come upgraded to military standards by default.",,,
expsp_asciislaught,SHIP,Anomalous signature appearing in the shape of the famous Onslaught battleship. Very dangerous.,,,
expsp_thunderer,SHIP,"Heavy unmanned strike craft used by MVS. Although the LPC can only manufacture one craft at a time, the design's devastating armament and excellent survivability allow it to prove a credible threat to anything it can catch up to. However, such abilities come at a significant cost per craft.",,,
expsp_supportdrone,SHIP,"Advanced PD drone mounted on elite MVS ships. Much of its internal space is devoted to providing targeting data to increase its effectiveness against fighters and missiles, making its dual Coil CIWS units and ventrally mounted PD laser devastating against enemy ordnance and small craft.",,,
expsp_scholarmvs,SHIP,"Mobile, well-armed battlecarrier used by elite MVS fleets. Its design was reverse-engineered from a damaged hull of a previously unknown design discovered near Duzakh. Although it has been significantly altered to fit MVS fleet doctrine, it still retains remnants of a design philsophy emphasizing mobility and firepower over survivability. Aggressive, fast, and capable of enhancing the performance of its fighters as well as itself, the Aquinas shines when under a skilled commander.",,,
expsp_abysswalker,SHIP,"Highly mobile battlecruiser that serves as the backbone of Mischmetal's capital ship fleets. Suprisingly well shielded and armored, the Abysswalker eschews the usual battlecruiser doctrine of sacrificing survivability, and instead trades direct firepower for versatility, agility, and durability. A well rounded complement of missile, ballistic, and energy mounts alongside a pair of modular fighter bays provides excellent loadout flexibility. Further augmenting already impressive mobility, the ship's Abyss Dash system briefly envelops the ship in a thin P-space field, increasing mobility and reducing incoming damage. Although incapable of truly teleporting the ship like the similar Phase Skimmer system, the Abyss Dash is far more reliable on larger vessels. Alongside its relatively undemanding logistics profile for a MVS vessel, these traits make the Abysswalker loved by its crews and allies.",,,
expsp_korsettes,SHIP,"Essentially a relativistic kill missile with a damper field, Delta core control unit, and a hyperdrive fitted internally, the Korsettes serves as a battering ram, disrupting enemy fleet formations. A prow-mounted kinetic beam allows it to slice through shielded vessels.",,,
expsp_lowe,SHIP,"Durable support drone that ses its potent EMP arsenal to disable targets, leaving them vulnerable for a killing blow from its mothership.",,,
expsp_scharfrichter,SHIP,"A rarity among MVS fleets, the Eustace-class interdictor destroyer was developed as a counter to the threat of phase vessels. Although slightly weakly armed for a destroyer of its cost, its disruptor system and powerful built-in stake driver allow it to disable and deal crippling damage to phase vessels.",,,
expsp_puukko,SHIP,"Light MVS frigate based off of the ubiquitous Wolf hull. Retains a similar weapons layout as its ancestor, albiet with more versatility alongside a PD drone and built in Poke missiles. However, an omnidirectional shield emitter ensures the vessel can better survive large engagements. Sister design to the more advanced Stiletto frigate, sharing approximately 60% parts commonality. 

Puukko captains are famous for their rivalry with Kampfmesser captains, the former favoring their superior firepower and burst mobility, the latter preferring heavier armor and sustained tactical mobility.",,,
expsp_cargodrone,SHIP,"Loader drone for placing cargo crates within the Kurierin's armored hull, equipped with a PD laser for use against debris, and in emergencies, incoming enemy fighters and ordnance. Surprisingly durable thanks to the ablative armor provided by an empty cargo crate.",,,
expsp_sunder_mvs,SHIP,"MVS refit of the Sector-standard Sunder destroyer, converted to house an integrated Reiterpallasch particle repeater instead of the usual central energy hardpoint. Enhanced armor, shields, and a pair of Attack Funnels improve survivability.

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,
expsp_dominion,SHIP,"The Dominion is an advanced MVS design with a distinctive ""flying wing"" silohuette. Maintenance-heavy, but capable of bringing a vast amount of firepower to bear through its numerous fighter bays and weapon mounts. Unlike the Astral's recall system, which is mostly useful for bombers, the Dominion's system can enhance performance of all varieties of fighter craft, increasing its versatility. Although not quite as formidable in frontline combat as the Legion or similar battlecarriers for its cost, the Dominion is capable of holding its own against other capital ships, unlike the frail Astral-class.",,,

expsp_sheath,SHIP,"Phase-capable combat drone found built into the Ascalon frigate. An internal temporal conduit allows for the craft to be affected by the time-altering equipment found on its parent vessel, though such equipment has not been successfully used on other designs. Armed with a powerful burst laser and a Light Needler, providing fire support to its mothership.",,,
expsp_ascalon,SHIP,"High-performance frigate developed using the most bleeding-edge technologies available to the forges of Mischmetal. Its central Temporal Overclock Core not only speeds up local time for itself, but also enhances its drone fighters. Much like the comparable Hyperion, the Ascalon's maintenance cost rivals that of some cruisers but can successfuly engage targets far above its weight class. Unlike its Tri-Tachyon counterpart, however, the Ascalon's systems are remarkably stable, allowing for a long engagement time before the ship must retreat for repairs. In return, the Ascalon lacks the Hyperion's excellent shields and flux core. ",,,

expsp_815,SHIP,"The Object 815 is a outdated design still used by MVS second-line defense fleets or to bulk up invasion forces. Mediocre in every aspect save for its excellent logistics performance and good durability. Armed with a veratile but limited hybrid weapons package more fitting on a heavy destroyer alonside a single modular fighter bay, the 815 has chronic issues with specialization. In this aspect, it is somewhat like the Sector-standard Eagle cruiser in that it can fill numerous roles well but lacks the standout performance that a more specialized hull could deliver.",,,
expsp_mirage,SHIP,"Versatile, long-ranged fighter used by MVS forces to pressure enemy vessels with its Electro-Flechette Launchers. Mobile and survivable, though its shields are fixed forwards, making it more vulnerable to interceptors. However, the EMP effect of its guns allows for effective suppression of enemy PD.",,,
expsp_lauretana,SHIP,"Heavy assault destroyer designed for assisting ground forces and engaging in boarding operations. Mobile, well-armored, but has only a single medium-class weapon mount.

Expensive compared to the Sector-standard Valkyrie, but can hold its own in fleet actions.",,,
expsp_testament,SHIP,"The Testament is a MVS redesign of the Manifesto-class used by the fleets of the PDPRC Red Guards, modernized and refitted to vastly outperform its predecessor, albeit at an increased maintenance cost. Improved automation allows for more space dedicated towards modifications, accommodations for a Large energy weapon have been made on the ship's primary weapon mount, the crude ammo feed system has been swapped for the Harmonization Core found on the Aquinas, and a LPC for a specialized wing of elite fighters has been integrated into the ship. Most importantly, however, the frontal bay has been swapped for a heavy beam array.



The Manifesto is a robust light battlecarrier. Armed with a versatile - if somewhat light - weapons package and equipped with advanced ammunition forging and delivery mechanisms to temporarily boost its firepower, the Manifesto excels at delivering heavy ballistic and strike craft support wherever it is needed in the battlespace.

expsp_florian,SHIP,"Bulky, expensive, and overbuilt, but beloved by its crews, the St. Florian is a rare example of a combat-rated tanker vessel. Its thick armor, decent weapons package, and complement of combat drones are sufficient to discourage all but the most determined pirate raiders. To prevent a lucky hit from the rear from causing a deadly chain reaction, the rearmost tanks are usually empty, serving as makeshift armor. For more dangerous foes, the St. Florian has a metaphorical ace up its sleeve. It possesses a teleporter device for warping destabilized fuel canisters directly into the enemy's midst, essentially a makeshift mine strike. Provided sufficient escort, the St. Florian can transport reasonable amounts of fuel while still being capable of shredding fighters as well as threatening frigates and larger vessels with limited shielding with its explosive antimatter payload.",,,

expsp_chrysostom,SHIP,"Light cruiser built around a pair of heavy kinetic missile tube arrays. Reasonably mobile and logistics friendly, allowing it to fit in a variety of fleet compositions. Designed to counter high-tech designs with near-constant kinetic missile pressure. Its unique system greatly improves missile speed, but hampers tracking and generates flux. However, its low number of modular slots means it must sacrifice either point defense or conventional firepower. ",,,
expsp_tzaphkiel,SHIP,"The Tzaphkiel-class Advanced Test Platform is the harbinger of a revolution in MVS ship design, boasting a plethora of advanced technologies both original and altered from existing designs. Incredibly agile for a ship of its size and carrying a weapons loadout similar in size to that of a Sunder-class, the Tzaphkiel would serve a formidable destroyer even without the advanced system it contains, albeit one with an exorbitant maintenance cost. Layers of enhanced composite plating paired with reinforced hull structure give it good survivability, especially considering its powerful flux core and better-than-average shield generator. However, the experimental flux core must have much of its structure exposed to avoid overheating. Passive venting on these exposed areas surrounds them with a signature golden light, often called ""eyes"" due to their shape. Despite all of these improvements on base MVS designs, the most exceptional aspects of this design are its primary weapon and active system. The experimental Nano-Pillar Projector can slowly strip away enemy armor or bash down their shields, albeit not at its full potential due to fears of the nanites within the projectiles consuming the ship instead of its foe. The Tzaphkiel's ""Lock"" EW system sends a torrent of scrap-code directly to an enemy ship's cogitation core, overwhelming the vessel's systems with conflicting data. This paralysis makes weapon locks fail, autoloaders freeze up, and engines lower output due to overheating issues that were never there to begin with. However, as abruptly as it struck, this disruption fades, in order to prevent the Lock Core from suffering overexertion issues of its own. With this array of bleeding-edge technology, the Tzaphkiel is a potent force multiplier to any fleet blessed enough to have one, provided it is in skilled hands.",,,
expsp_helena,SHIP,"Allegedly a scrapped pre-Collapse pocket battlecruiser design recently recovered and retrofitted into a civilian cruiser for both export and domestic use. Designed with survivability in mind, the St. Helena-class is bristling with PD mounts, well-armored, and posesses a damper field-enhanced burn to quickly escape dangerous situations. One of the few cruiser-sized vessels in the Sector with a salvage gantry, the Helena is valued by both MVS and Independent salvage fleets for its ability to rapidly recover valuable components from debris fields while enjoying relative safety. In combat, the Helena-class' military heritage shows, as it still possesses a reasonable armament alongside its support drones.",,,

Decent defensive armament and missile-capable weapon mounts allow it to support its fighters from relatively close range, aided by relatively thick armor and a powerful flux core for a carrier. Its excellent mobility is further bolstered by a series of secondary boosters, reactor overclock protocols, and enhanced afterburners for its strikecraft, allowing both mothership and fighters to achieve blisteringly fast top speeds. Lacks the bite of a Heron's targeting systems, but can harrass all but the most agile of foes with little risk of retaliation.",,,
