Although the Infernal Machine inspired the Infernus-class copycat hull design, the original ship was thought lost when Kanta famously defeated Harcourt over the skies of Maxios.\n\nYou have managed to unearth the wreckage of the Infernal Machine, spending your fortunes to repair the hull and bring it online as your own flagship. As you lean back in your grandfather's old throne, you begin to plot revenge against Kanta and her so-called pirate cronies...\n\nSpecial: Restore and upgrade the Infernal Machine, one step at a time, at any friendly dockyard.
