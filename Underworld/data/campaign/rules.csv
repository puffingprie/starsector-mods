OpenComms","Your tech officer screams incoherently as the tactical displays flash through horrifying, alien symbols before rebooting. Your comms officer starts praying to any gods that will listen. You look out through the viewscreen.

They loom before you, a cancer upon the vacuum of space. The hulls are gnarled, bent, twisted as if caught writhing in endless agony. The scored armor panels scream of sickness, rather than battle. A shadow seems to creep from the enemy fleet, spreading towards you like a veil of corruption.

Something dies inside of you, wrenching your soul. The abominations arrayed before you lack some crucial aspect of humanity, like a cup with no bottom.",,
