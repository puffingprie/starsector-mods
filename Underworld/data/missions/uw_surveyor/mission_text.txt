During a routine reconnaissance mission, the captain of the TTS Parse intercepted a Hegemony distress signal. Choosing to investigate, the small fleet moved through the asteroid belt to the source of the transmission. What they found there would haunt the captain's nightmares for the rest of his days. The Hegemony fleet lay in ruins, and the TTS Parse finds itself surrounded by an ambush fleet helmed by an enormous unclassified vessel. Unfortunately for the captain, the High Board has made it clear that retreat is not an option.

Take command of the TTS Parse in a sudden and desperate fight for your life against a vastly superior, hitherto unknown pirate super-ship.
