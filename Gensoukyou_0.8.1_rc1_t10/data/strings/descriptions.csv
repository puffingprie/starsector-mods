FM_Rotation,SHIP,"The Kaiten Class is metaphorically the start of Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet design. Various testing conducted on the Kaiten framework has served as the foundation for the development of Gensoukyou Manufacture's own unique naval theory. Its energy system and weapon slots feature higher output than those in typical frigates. Adapting spiritual energy in its support system, the Kaiten class is able to take damage for other ships. This feature allows it to excel in large scale fleet engagements.

The Kaiten demonstrates early phases of technological integration between either side of the Boundary, and exemplifies assault ship design philosophies of the Expansion Era. Specifically, the Kaiten class features high maneuverability, energy weapons, and basic spiritual-energy-based modular tactical systems.  Despite its simple design, the ship remains versatile and largely mitigated the limitations of Expansion Era designs in large-scale combat.

While drone systems are not included in earlier models, influential individuals from within the Boundary pushed for the inclusion of auxiliary drone systems known as “Kedama”. This system has since became standard in all modern variants  Recently,  Kaiten class ships are commonly seen in parades with the Kedama drones onboard being used to create visual spectacle with their excellent atmospheric maneuverability and “Danmaku” patterns. 

The crew and captain of Kedama class are known for their dedication and self-sacrifice in cultural zeitgeist, often inspired by legends and stories from inside the Boundary.

FM_Firefly,SHIP,"A Multi-purpose frigate designed around its medium universal slot, it is equipped with flux conduits and small auxiliary weaponries on par with expansion era frigates. Often seen in small skirmishs due to its simple design easy maintenance, but at times also seen with missiles to support and harras foes in large engagements. Its relatively decent mobility and capability to deploy Active Decoys ensures high survivability.

The Hotaru class was initially a poorly thought of project that underwent several iterations. The project was commenced on the day of Gensoukyou Manufacture revealed themselves in the sector, and designed for low intensity security missions. The project was only saved from the cutting board at the protest of civilian Organization on the inner-side of the boundary. Althought the project's fund and technical support was fairly strained compared to typical projects that are sponsored by Gensoukyou Manufacture, thanks to a talented young engineer from the outside and his assistant (and later wife, rumoured to be non-human) from the inner side, the Project was finally completed after many trials and errors. There have been numerous related literary works that have been made on this topic since then.

The exact technical details of it also confirm the authenticity of the aforementioned story, Combining the standard combat capability of an expansion era military frigate with logistic efficiency that's comparable to high-grade civillian frigates, and outfitting the ship with a less fancy but versitile active flare system allows the ship to perform quite well for its intended purposes. Its also capable enough to deliver enough firepower to punish those who underestimate this small bug of a ship. With its excellent general purpose mount and nimble mobility it's quite impressive when used in large numbers.

FM_Rabbit,SHIP,"Commonly used as the core of a small detachment, this ship is equipped with standardized weapon and energy systems. It is light, fast, and powerful with capability to scatter light minefields making it particularly effective on small to medium scale skirmishs.

Designed after the re-appearance of Gensoukyou Manufacture, the design has been rushed through development as a emergency production vessal by taking reference from several popular frigates from the outside the faction. While retaining most qualitys of a conventional frigate such as small missiles, the Usagi class is in a sense the true inspiration for the current Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrines. Relying on its versatility provided by its shipsystem and armaments to strike, the frigate is able to take its sustained firepower to a whole new level while maintaing the excellent mobility and decent shielding of expansion era vessals. 

Since the beginning of constant raids from luddic pathers, the Usagi class has always been active on the frontlines to the point that during early production runs it was produced nearly as ubiquitously as civilian shuttles. However with the directive of a more diverse fleet, the role of Usagi is now being replaced by more specialized ships. There are still a large number of Usagi class ships that have gone into civilian usage, or are reserved as second-line roles like training ships. The frigate mirrors a typical saying within the sector, ""old soldiers never die"".

FM_Parasol,SHIP,"An expensive and advanced armed freighter, the Karakasa prioritize mobility when fighting alone in an engagement and is fitted with relatively less common hybrid weapon mounts. Its relatively high capability for a civilian ship has let it reach to that of standard military frigates. Due to a combined factor of its high cost and difficulty in acquisition, it has almost no market in the smuggling scenes.

Nevertheless there is still a place for this excessively-capable design for the surveyor who cannot afford a larger exploration ship - the Karakasa-class are their best caretaker. Thanks to its highly automated subsystem the ship can be easily be operated by small crew. With decent fuel and cargo spaces and aerodynamic design for atmospheric re-entry, it's an ship excellent for planetary exploration and surveillances. With solid armament configuration and support drones, the Karakasa is capable enough to repel small pirates forces that are looking for troubles in outskirt of sector. Truely an all-purpose ship.

Due to its popularity in exploration organizations that focus on exploring the unknown, and thus often making up tall tales, the Karakasa is often illustrated as a cute young girl in popular fiction. Despite seeming to incorporate good number of the legends from the inner side of the boundary such as tsukumogami, the outside world's passion for derivative work for this character countinues unhindered. For some reason there was an urban legend circulating on comm networks that suggests the girl is actually real.

FM_Egret,SHIP,"A Fast Carrier with impressive mobility, placing significant emphasis on bomber strikes while also possessing a certain degree of long range support capability. Without proper support the ship's weakness in ability to maintain constant suppression will become obvious. 

Representing the carrier strike doctrine in the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet, it tries to improve the conventional expansion era strategy of torpedo strike by placing it on an entirely new highly agile platform. Notably, its advanced shipsystem ""Solitary Egret"" can be combined with advanced bombers such as ""Amanojyaku"" to deliver payloads with great efficiency.

However, despite being widely used as the main striking force, the shipsystem also contributes to pilots survivability. The reputation and word of mouth about the Egret within the lower ranks are far from the expected positive images, especially in fleets where a higher proportion of inner Boundary crew members are present. There are widespread legends particularly suggesting that the ""Solitary Egret"" can influence luck and other superstitions. The internal affairs department has supressed talk about the subject and givin responses on these matters multiple times to ""dispel the superstition"" but the result seems to have little effect, despite statistical data that indicate low casualty rates for this ship.

FM_Puppeteer,SHIP,"A Agile, fast, and elegant small carrier with two hangar bays equipped with maintenances facility as well an efficient shields. its capable enough to hold its line at any range while also able to surpress the enemy defensive capability.

Unlike common carrier like the Heron or the Condor, the Margatroid class has quite the elegant and streamlined appearance with a embellished and aerodynamic design. If one were to describe its appearance in human terms, perhaps only the word 'maiden' could properply describe everything about her. On the otherhand, as a combat carrier, the Margatroid class is extremely efficient in its lethality, especially combined with its shipsystem thats use technology derived from the inner-side of the Boundary it can interfere and disrupt targets PD weaponry. When combined with the ship's unique and specialized built-in module, the ship's fighters are able to shread close range targets on command.

Although there exists signs of negative mental effect on the pilots and even captain of this ship caused by the deep involvement of the inner side of the Boundary in this ship's design, such as the design of the built-in moudule, many crew still gladly serve on this class of ship. Perhaps because of this, in popular fiction the Margatroid's onboard sub-system AI is often potrayed as a young girl who has obsessive devotion to someone to the point of causing mental disturbance to those people.

FM_Aya,SHIP,"A examplary specimen of light Gensoukyou Manufacture ship, combining excellent mobility with small amount of flexible weaponries and a squadron of drones. Further supported with its special Fuujin shipsystem to traverse through phase space in short period. Making it a formidable ship to engage all of type of enemy.

Developed on a combination of miniature phase technology and improvement on expansionist era assualt theory achieved by deviation from the established norm. The Literary class sacrifices considerably on armor and hull integrity to achieve unusually high speed and mobility for a destroyer. Following standard Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrine, the Literary class relies on its drones to complement its sustained firepower. Unlike many expansion era ships that are often mocked as  ""glass cannons"" , the ship's flux cunduit and shield system are capable enough to allow the ship to survive against a stronger enemy. With a shipsystem that essentially guarantees escape route at any time, even less experienced captain can utilize the ship's potential to some degree.

The Literary class was also important to the formation of modern Gensoukyou Manufacture Fleet doctrine. Despite being designed before Gensoukyou Manufcature's exposure to the Sector, combat report of the Literary class demonstrated the potential of the sustained suppressive firepower theory and ability to perform PD task without relying on a large number of small weapon slots. Due to this important history and the simple and clean image of this ship, this ship's silhouette often used as an unnofficial symbol for Gensoukyou Manufacture ships.

In popular fiction, while it does not appear as often as the mysterious and advanced ships that often serve as the main character's personal ship, she still see common apperance. ""After all, who doesnt love a cool little Crow?""

FM_Miko,SHIP,"One of the most precious mass-produced destroyers that can be found in the persean sector, the Miko, integrated with the spiritual framework, possesses weapon adaptability surpassing most Gensoukyou-built ships and maintains the faction's well-known high mobility. This atypical design allows it flourish in high-risk engagement. 

First developed as a project to improve the phase skimmer system to be based on spirtual energy within the Boundary, its development was largely handled by the inner side of the Boundary after it nearly drove several engineer from outside insane. Despite initial distrust from the outer side, when the final design was completed, almost everyone was shocked by this ship's astonishing performance, and voices of doubt and opposition dissipated.

Unlike the expansion-era ships that adopt cutting edge tech without regard to the quality of crew life, the Miko, though possessing an bizarre internal structure like most ships engineered by the inner side of the Boundary , still alows most crew members to maintain a relatively normal mental state during operation. However, perhaps due to some mysterious effect of the spiritual framework, crews of the Miko class often report witnessing a series of incredible events. The most famous of these is the rumored incident near Blazing Hell in the year 193, where a large asteroid expected to impact the surface and the prototype of the Miko class which was undergoing early testing at the time experienced a resonance phenomenon, causing the asteroid to deviate from the orbit and avoided the impact.

FM_Witch,SHIP,"Designed to pursue the limits of firepower, the ship is fragile yet so deadly that it can be considered the Gensoukyou Manufacture version of the Super Mudskipper MK2. 

The inner-side of the Boundary engineered the weapon system and while the shipsystem, flux core, hull is made by the outside. The ship carries distinctive characteristics of a collaborative project between the inner-side and outer-side of the Boundary. This destroyer emphasizes striking capabilities. This is why all of its anti-ship configurations ends up quite radical, while the shipsystem, although conventional, always prove quite effective.

However, As a result of the excessive budget spent by the inner side of the Boundary on armaments and exterior design, and even with the best effort from the outside to provide a decent shielding and flux system, this ship is still prone to dying horribly after running out of missiles in battle. What a poor child...

FM_Konpaku,SHIP,"A light cruiser design with a relatively bulky size but high agility. The Tamashi-Class features an impressive array of energy weapons, cute yet dangerous drones, and highly efficient conventional engines. It is especially valuable in missions focused on hunting down small targets.

The Tamashi-class is a peculiar design created through brainstorming of several non-human like engineers from within the inner side of the Boundary after studying and learning from multiple expansion era designs. The prototype was then fine-tuned by a few young technicians from the outside world. While the ship overall adheres to the Gensoukyou Manufacture's fleet doctrine of sustained firepower, its primary role still overlaps with conventional expansion era light cruisers: relying on a powerful flux system and maneuverability, coupled with versatile energy weapons, to suppress enemy light vessels. However, when comparing the two, the Tamashi-class's lack of burst damage becomes quite apparent. It often relies on its mobility and flux system for self-preservation when facing true heavy ships instead of being able to fight back.

Perhaps due to frequently appearing in the public eye as the flagship of light fleets in resolving small-scale conflicts, the Tamashi, with its clean and simple appearance, enjoys considerable popularity among the general populace. As a result, the Tamashi often secures the top spot in some sketchy popularity polls on comm networks, and there are even rumors suggesting that the Tamashi is highly popular in similar events hosted within pirate and pathers.

FM_Satori,SHIP,"While often assigned to auxiliary and support tasks, the Neru-class is essentially a versatile cruiser, with a flexible weapon array that allows it to play a significant role in both small and large-scale engagement.

As one of the few large ships designed before the re-apperance of Gensoukyou Manufacture, the Neru-class is somewhat of a budgetary miracle. In a scenario where most funds were allocated to economic development and the design of small ships, a design team primarily composed of outsider researchers managed to achieve performance beyond expectations by utilizing some of the excavated Domain-era technologies from within the Boundary despite limited funding. On the other hand, due to substantial support from individuals and civilian organizations within the Boundary, the development of the Neru-class's ship systems and built-in modules proceeded quite smoothly (Although it did cause various degrees of temporary psychological damage to many outsiders participants along the way).

In the days following the re-apperance, the Neru-class has consistently been tasked with supporting light fleets in combating pirates and pathers. Perhaps due to the deterrent power of its ship systems, fear of the Neru-class has now become commonplace in the underworld.

FM_Yagokoro,SHIP,"Undoubtedly the flagship of the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet, the Yagokoro-class is a flexible and efficient multipurpose capital ship. However, to fully unleash its capabilities, it requires an exceptionally skilled commander.

Although most of the research and development funds were invested in the development of small ships before the re-appearance of Gensoukyou Manufacture, the Yagokoro-class still received sufficient resources to sustain a slow-paced development. This is done as an emergency plan upon re-appearance. Because of the above reasons, significant portion of the ship's structure had already been designed before the re-appearance. After the re-appearance and re-contact, the project naturally received the highest priority and was rapidly put into combat.

From a design perspective, the Yagokoro partially inherited the theory of concentrated application of large carriers and strike crafts from the Expansion Era, while absorbing some typical battleship elements. This hybrid design, coupled with advanced support AI from within the Boundary and an enormous wide range displacement device known as the ""Endless Gallery"" makes the Yagokoro a extremely practical design.

Like the stories within the Boundray suggest, the present-day Yagokoro mainly undertakes the defense of important targets like their namesake. In popular fiction, the commander and AI assistant of the Yagokoro-class are often depicted as wise sages.

FM_Miracle,SHIP,"A typical Gensoukyou Manufacture ship renowned for its frontal firepower and sustained suppression capabilities. The Kiseki-class possesses formidable resilience and diverse tactical applications that seem to defy its basic parameters, seemingly giving it abilities to create miracles.

The initial design of the Kiseki-class was almost unrelated to the outside. It was originally being steadily developed as a civilian cargo ship for a civilian organization within the Boundary. The original design was a modular transport vessel designed for rapid shipping tasks, intentionally excluding shields and relying solely on a special ships system called the ""Miracle of Winds"" for protection. However, with the re-appearance, the government began searching for alternative designs. Due to the exceptional performance of the ""Miracle of Winds"" system, which replaced shields in the original design, the Kiseki project was swiftly militarized.

Thanks to the earlier modular design, the Kiseki-class could accommodate the most advanced flux systems and corresponding weapon arrays available at the time in Gensoukyou Manufacture. The remaining researchers from within the boundary once again optimized its power system and outer hull. In the end, this ship, which defied common sense but exuded a unique sense of the mystical, joined the fleet of Gensoukyou Manufacture, continually creating new miracles.

To commemorate this miraculous development process, all Kiseki-class ships have the simplified emblem of the original civilian organization painted in specific locations.

FM_Byakuren,SHIP,"An intermediate ship between a battlecruiser and a battleship, the Byakuren-class possesses considerable sustained firepower and relatively good maneuverability for a capital ship, though it cannot be considered supercapital at this time.

Representing the cutting-edge of conventional Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrines, the Byakuren-class boasts ample sustained firepower and a relatively flexible equipment arrangement. Its compact hull structure relies primarily on efficient shields and its inherent maneuverability for defense. However, from a logistical perspective, the expensive and challenging-to-maintain Byakuren-class is clearly unsuitable for widespread construction. Not to mention, the Byakuren-class places significant demands on the quality of its commanders and crew members. The combination of these factors makes this type of ship relatively rare in the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet.

Regardless of these challenges, when the Byakuren-class charges through enemy lines with lightning speed and unleashes its firepower at close range, all voices of oppositions becomes inconsequential. After all, everyone's sage has more important things to do.

FM_Nightbird,SHIP,"A high-speed electronic warfare vessel with a certain degree of interferences capability. The Yasuzume demonstrates considerable efficiency in supporting large capital ships and countering missiles. However, this doesn't mean it cannot participate in skirmish like a conventional ship.

The image of Yasuzume is almost entirely different from the original design of a resilient electronic warfare vessel as envisioned by Gensoukyou Manufacture. After numerous modifications and adjustments by the Yasuzume design team, It ultimately achieved the initial requirements in a different form. This was accomplished by significantly reducing conventional armor and extensive use of low-cost composite materials, granting Yasuzume unparalleled speed and maneuverability. Multiple redundant systems and automated damage control allows the ship to carry on with its missions even after the ship has lost its armored protection. The central ECM system, serving as the ship's core, can handle dangerous missiles from a relatively long distance. The tenacity of a ship with such a design is clear.

On the other hand, rumors suggest that the Yasuzume project is accompanied by a peculiar romantic story. Unfortunately, due to the existence of confidentiality regulations and similar constraints, the specific plot details are left to the imaginations of the reader.

Despite such drastic modifications, the modern Kagerou-class remains simple and reliable, much like its early models. After all, in this region of space dominated by missiles, the best way to protect allies is to use more missiles to defeat the enemy first...

FM_Hearn,SHIP,"A highly unusual cruiser design, with its shipsystems and integrated modules significantly enhancing the operational efficiency of space superiority fighters, while also possessing sufficient firepower for direct engagement.

Although ostensibly designed as a cruiser-level solution for fleet point defense and space superiority operations in Gensoukyou Manufacture's fleet doctrine, the Hearn-class more commonly serves in anti-ship combat missions during actual combat. The ship's jump system, adapted from the Miko-class's mystical skimmer system, allows it to effortlessly teleport most of its fighter intact to the vicinity of enemy ships for a strike. The Hearn-class itself has direct firepower comparable to a conventional destroyer with a superior flux system, supporting it in both point defense and anti-ship combat. All these factors together making the Hearn-class one of the most impressive ship in medium to small-scale engagements.

However, as a ship primarily developed by the inner side of the Boundary, the internal structure and ship systems of the Hearn-class remains characteristically perplexing. Although not surrounded by rumors of disruption to its crew's mental state like some other designs, statistical data does suggest that serving on the Hearn-class does heighten an individual's mental sensitivity. That said, serving on the ship has not caused any truly severe psychological damage to anyone so far.

FM_Rumia,SHIP,"Representing the next generation of ships incorporating Spell Framework design, the Yuugure-class is a somewhat rare sight due to insufficient emphasis placed on phase ships by Gensoukyou Manufacture as well as being a newer ship class.

While the design was initially guided by the policy of directly adapting the phase ship usage from the Expansion Era, Gensoukyou Manufacture's peculiar application of technology ultimately transformed the ship into something almost entirely different from mainstream phase ships.

As the first ship to integrate the Spell Framework, the Yuugure-class's shipsystems design is quite extraordinary. Thanks to the Spell Frame's ability to allow direct manipulation of spiritual energy and a spirit vessel to store that energy, an all-purpose weapon system known as the Cross of Dark Majesty can be installed. The Cross of Dark Majesty makes the Yuugure-Class an extremely rare ship with both balanced offensive and defensive capabilities (But the massive amount of space taken by the weapon inevitably leads to a lack of conventional weaponry). This dual capability significantly enhances the ship's flexiblity, to some extent compensating for the major weakness of phase ships. However, this also contributes to the fairly high maintenance costs and peculiar maintenance difficulty, making it somewhat costly to maintain compared to other phase ships of its class.

Although designed in the early days of Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrine, the Reisen-class is undoubtedly perfect light ship under expansion era doctrines: the precise teleportation based on Mystical Skimmer solidified the doctrine of ""Surprise"" into the ship's very hull. Combined with the firepower configuration dominated by energy weapons and the usual high maneuverability, it must be acknowledged that the the Reisen-class is more comparable to a conventional Expansion Era ships than some Gensoukyou Manufacture designs.

On the other hand, the flaw of the old theory is also evident considering the repeatedly reinforced but still fragile armored hull and insufficient firepower for a head on engagement. Therefore, overall, mastering such a ship still requires substantial experience and courage.

FM_IcicleFall,WEAPON,"Icicle is a standard anti-ship pulse weapon capable of continuously projecting partially ionized energy bolt with a relative high rate of fire. However, the weapon's high rate of fire also leads to the fluctuation in the bolt's trajectory and even instability in the bolts themselves...

This renowned multi-purpose pulse weapon operates on fairly traditional principles: A high-frequency pulse laser is used to destabilize the gaseous-state ammunition, which are then launched via an accelerator. Due the use of unconventional gas ammunition and pulse generator, the internal components of the resulting energy bolt often begin to react with each other over time, leading to the disintegration and splitting of the projectiles. However, this peculiar quirk combination actually give this weapon more possible uses, since it allows the projectile can still reach or sometime even exceed the weapon's paper max range.",General,,,

The new design finally rectified the embarrassing display that caused Icicle Fall's energy beams to split and miss their target. However, the cost of rectifying the issue is a significant increase in energy requirements...",General,,,

Intergrating such high energy output into a medium energy weapon is quite absurd no matter how you look at it. What is even more shocking is void blade's terrifying energy efficiency.

The container will disperse a large number of self-guided missiles in flight, with extremely high potential destructive power. Theoretically, direct hits on enemy ships can also cause considerable damage, but in practice, the projectile's pitfully slow flight speed makes this very difficult.

Initially designed as the Stardust Reverie, its function was to disperse a large number of unguided support danmaku along the projectile's flight path as its primary way to deal damage. However, with the introduction of larger Yakouchuu, the project shifted to using interceptible but more useful missile-type secondary projectiles, and the weapon's name is also changed drastically as a result.",Strike,,,

Furthermore, given useful features like high single shot damage and good flux efficiency, even a fool this weapon can be used to great effect. However, it does require this fool to have enough courage to get close to the enemy to fire this weapon, because the weapon's projectile speed is even more pitiful than the Hellbore Cannon.",Supression,,,

Against ships, the tremendous soft flux impact generated by seveteen beams is enough to threaten shield systems.

By replacing the amplifying medium and redesigning the charging system, Gensoukyou Manufacture increased the efficiency of conventional Burst PD lasers to a frightening level at the cost of firing frequency and charging time. However, given the urgent need for wide-area PD weapons, the weapon ultimately incorporated a spirit leap system calibrated by experts from the inner side of the Boundaries.

Although all systems of this weapon correspond to energy weapon slots in engineering, fundamentally, it resembles a hybrid of projectile and energy weapons. The weapon uses a technology similar to railguns and gauss cannons by directly launching a physical warhead, with ballistic properties. However, the weapon mainly relies on the enormous energy shockwave generated by the specially manufactured projectiles upon impact with the target to deal energy damage.

Integrating the energy charging system using Spiritual Charge and utilizing Inter-Gap cycling system taking up the entire frontal portion of the ship allows all flux generated by this weapon to be ""consumed"". With this basis, a new particle acceleration system and capacitor design ensure the weapon's ability to fire at high intensity and high speed. 

At the same time, the weapon also has a clear flaw. Without the precisely enginereed Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly System, the weapon's massive Spiritual Charge consumption would deplete a spirit vessel with a single shot within a single capcitor's firing cycle, limiting the weapon's use to being an integrated armament of Miko-class.

The predecessor of the modern Hinotama was a type of support drone. It was designed to simplify maintenance by removing unnecessary shielding, installing cheap engines, and thickening armor as alternatives protection, thus controlling costs. However, the soaring cost arising out of the series of experimental changes and the engineering team's misguided experimental approach ultimately led to the failure of the development of this proposed support drone. 

In the spirit of fully utilizing resources, the failed support drone prototype eventually became a testing platform for another new tactical system. This new system, incorporating time-dilation technology for enhanced maneuverability, was found to generate a series of bizarre physical phenomena along the trajectory of the drone, causing significant damage to surrounding entities. Therefore, the Hinotama prototype was further equipped with thicker armor and replaced its long-range weapons with a more destructive close-range version of the Void Blade, resulting in this bizarre attack drone.
