	-Added two Ommatidia to the Lucanidae for symmetry with the ship image

v 1.08 -Save game compatible but if you have a captured Hiver logistics ships with Militarized Subsystems on it you want to remove it before installing or it may get wonky

	-Changed supplies/rec and supplies/mo form 14 to 24 on the Cerambycidae and the Scarabaeidae -  14 was higher than an Atlas but they are beefier
	-Raised the fleet points of all Hiver ships by 10% - Correctly calculates their strength when used in AI vs AI battles based on their stats/loadouts vs vanilla ships
	-Removed the block on Hiver patrols remembering patrol data - Makes their home systems a little more dangerous
	-Reduced the value of the Ommatidia weapon by 25% - received numerous complaints that even though it is a trophy it was still too high a value

	-Added the built in mod Delicate Machinery to all Hiver phase ships - It is pretty standard for phase ships and gives them a bit of a nerf
	-Raised the deployment points and supplies used per month on the Crabby and the Eyes - when going over the phase ships they were a little low
	-Raised the phase cost and upkeep on all Hiver phase ships - Reduces the time they can stay in phase and heal

			-Initial Hiver markets no longer show up on the StelNet commodity market - Numerous requests and finally untangled it 
			-Initial Hiver planets no longer initially show as owned on the sector map - They will show when discovered by the player same as others 
			-Initial Hiver planets and stations are no longer the target of vanilla quests - Note: this and the above two notes do not effect planets that Hivers conquer	
	-Deleted the instructions on the forum OP and in the README for re-enabling their markets since this update does that by default - again sorry for the hassle

v1.04 - 1.03 save game compatible
	-Lowered the cost of all Hiver weapons by 50% - TY alaricdragon for noting that the risk/reward for loot as a total salvage was still too high on the reward end
	-Increased the range on the Ommatidia from 80 to 100 and the damage from 1 to 2 - More of a sellable trophy than a weapon but with the price drop I buffed it a little
	-Starting with the new lowered prices as the base, I increased the cost spread between small medium and large weapons -TY steve1592 for making the case
	-Added the tags "no_dealer, no_sell" to all Hiver ships and weapons to prevent them from showing up under the Arms Dealer - TY Paragon Bane for pointing this out

	-Widened the firing arcs of the Prince's medium turret mounts from 60 degrees to 75 degrees to accommodate the new placement on the updated sprite
	-Re-sized the Lucanidae to be more SS compatible - The original sprite I used from Spiral arms was huge and it was a good time to address it
	-Added a second Ommatidia mount to the Eyes for symmetry on the updated sprite
	-Slightly darkened the details on the Princess to be more in line with the other ships - essentially it doesn't shine as much now
	-Changed the settings for Hiver relations using the code generously donated by Harmful Mechanic - essentially if a faction ever reaches neutral with them it will automatedly reset to vengeful- TY HM!
	-Deleted some unneeded code that could potentially cause a small memory leak - old code from a previous version that I hadn't removed in 1.02 my bad sorry	
	-Added a line of Fragmentary damage beams (sm,med.lg) to the Hiver Lineup of weapons - Ty steve1592 for the suggestion noting they lacked a frag weapon

	-Raised the energy per shot of the Svreraxx Bio-Plasmic Catapult from 192 to 230 as a balance change - TY sevhern for noting it's efficiency was too OP
	-Increased the supplies/rec and supplies/mo of every Hiver ship by 15% (rounded up) - This will lower the amount of ships Hivers can deploy at once
	-Increased the fleet points on the Emperor from 55 to 60 - Being one of the strongest ships in the game it deserved a little more
	-Added a file named unrecoverable_ship_data.csv located in data/hulls - If you delete the current ship_data.csv and rename the new file ship_data.csv it will make all Hiver ships and their BP unrecoverable
	-Added a file named unrecoverable_weapon.data_csv located in data/weapons If you delete the current weapon_data.csv and rename the new file weapon_data.csv it will make all Hiver weapons unrecoverable
	-NOTE: If you retain the current ship_data but use the new weapon_data then weapons can still be recovered from wrecks and salvaged wrecks but not as salvage themselves

	-Replaced the vanilla weapons on the Flyter with Hiver ones - Made that drone before I made the hiver weapons 
	-Halved the value of all Hiver weapons - Island makes a good point that individually it was a reward but as a whole loot haul it was a bit much
	-Increased the size and explosion radius of the Xrrymm-type Hive and Launcher Istkrrtc-type Hive missile sprites to be more visually hefty - Island made the point that they looked like pop-guns
	-Widened the sprites for the Xrrymm-type Hive and the Istkrrtc-type Hive in order to fit the larger missiles made for this patch
	-Hiver Xrrymm-type Hive and Istkrrtc-type Hive now properly render and fire all their missiles - Been meaning to fix that	
	-Lowered the hit points of the Scorpifly from 1800 to 1500 and armor from 450 to 400 - Island made the point that it was on par with a destroyer and this puts it just above the Flyter
	-Increased the range of the Ommatidia from 60 to 80 - gives it an actual chance to engage fighters
	-Added a new light cruiser, the Caelifera - the Hiver fleet lacked a light cruiser and with the increase in overall fleet supply use it fills a niche role
	-Added the new ship and all updated sprites to their respective images on the forum OP
	
v1.0 -.99 save game compatible - Note: IF you have a captured Cleradie in your fleet it may need to be re-armed

	-Increased the deployment and supply use of the Viridan and Crabby to 9 - noticed they were set low as well
	-Fixed an error with the Cleradie using the Crabby variant as it's standard loadout - Must have been an issue for a bit sorry about that
	-Replaced the Ommatidia weapon mounts on all Hiver ships that had them - there was an issue with looting them - TY Bonisagus for pointing that out
	-Added a missing weapon on the Calopteryx standard loadout - noticed it when I was replacing the Ommatidia
	-Fixed a misaligned turret mount on the Hornet - It was facing backward instead of forward - idk 
	-Added Ommatidia mounts to the Moth - If a Hiver needed eyes it was this one :)
	-Added Ommatidia mounts to the Viridula - For the cuteness factor
	-Did a spelling, grammar and punctuation check on all Hiver asset descriptions - woo wee it needed that
	-Added the Ommatidia to the list of Hiver "knownweapons" - in case that was causing an issue since it is not on their BP
	-Updated the replacement ship pack RAR to 1.0 - you will need to re-install it if you are using it
	-Added the Ommatidia to the list of blacklisted weapons from from Amity's Freeport discount trader is you are using the SCY mod - Love SCY but no eyes for them! 

v0.99 -0.98 save compatible - some changes will only take effect in a new game
	-Fixed an error with the Queen's Tech being BioTech instead of Bio Tech - TY alaricdragon for noticing it
	-Reduced the range and damage of the Ezkepren-type Hive torpedo -received numerous concerns that the Gnawler was too OP and making the game less fun
	-Added additional tips on how to fight Hivers under the spoiler tags on the main page - TY to Candelestine for their writeup on reddit
	-Reduced the turn rate on the Emperor from 40 to 30 - Saw a discussion on Discord that made some good points regarding its size vs nimbleness
	-Touched up the graphic on the Princess giving her darker green highlights and tinting the weapon mounts - Sort of stood out how bright she was
	-Touched up the graphic for the Chinavia, Lacewing, Viridan, Viridula, Silverfish and Aphid by darkening the tint and sharpening the lines - Same reason as above	
	-Added a new EMP "weapon", Hiver Eyes - They are mounted on each bio-metal style Hiver ship - More of a high value sellable than actual useable weapon, also adds a little cosmic horror :)
	-Replaced the Pristine Nanoforges with Corrupted on all Hiver planets with the exception of their capital, Vilani  - Should satisfy the multiple requests to tone down their fleet production
		-Note: The above change does not effect fleets that are already in game so will not be as noticeable in a saved game
	-Added the UNBOARDABLE AI tag to the Beetle so they cannot be recovered like the Emperor and Queen - I felt that it too was a tad too OP to put in player hands
	-Added the no_drop UI tag to the Beetle, Emperor and Queen to prevent their blueprint from dropping during exploration missions
	-Updated the folder used in the replacement ships RAR to match the current folder 0.99 - Should have been doing that since 0.95, my bad
	-Remade the forum OP ship image to reflect the graphic changes made this update
	-Made a separate image on the forum OP that shows the lineup if you use the replacement images - Again something I should have done a bit ago, ah well better late than never

v0.98

	-Changed the Tech Tree that Hiver ships and weapons are listed under from High Tech to Bio Tech 
	-Removed the shields on every Hiver drone and increased their HP by 20% - I believe this will address OP complaints while interacting with their bio hull better - this *should* bring them in line and more manageable
	-Added a flag to the Emperor and the Queen to be UNBOARDABLE, meaning that they cannot be recovered - These two are OP living ships and are meant only for Hivers
	-Raised the price of every Hiver weapon by 100k to reflect tier above average status - Ty gentuff for the suggestion
	-Increased the probability that a Hiver ship will explode to 90% - *Should* make their ships, based on this stat, to be in the worst shape if recovered
	-Lowered the combat readiness recovery per day by 1 for each hiver ship - slows down their recovery if they are fleeing a battle, doing a hard burn or coming out of a storm
	-Added a missing description for the Krrakt Thermionic Exiter weapon
	-Added a missing description for the Cerambycidae capital tanker
	-Added a new ship system Bio Energy Focus - Similar to High Energy focus but longer lasting and more charges for a higher flux use plus it glows a nice Hiver green when activated :)

v0.97 - Save Compatible with 0.96 however, The Rizdet system change will only take effect on a new game start
	-Moved the Rizdet star system to be clustered with the other two Hiver systems - due to the aggression fixes in the last patch it no longer needs to be so far away
	-Increased the flux per shot of every Hiver energy weapon by 10% - Ty derrzzedd for making the case their weapons were a bit too OP
	-Decreased the ammo count of the Istkrrtc-type Hive by 3 and the Xrrymm-type Hive by 4 - A needed fix for their damage
	-Reduced the speed of the Beetle, Carabidae, Queen, Emperor, and Lucanidae by 10% - These are the larger tankier Hiver ships that with their armor needed a little nerf
	-Added hostile flags for Iron Shell and HMI - TY gufiu for noticing those two factions were too close to neutral
	-Changed the percentage of hull that the BIO Hull mod kicks in from 90 to 95% - Will kick in faster and repair more

v0.96 -Save compatible with V 0.95 -IF you have them set to be playable revisit the instructions on the forum OP - I recommend a new game start to take advantage of all changes  
	-Added a "Buy me a Coffee" tip link to Ko-Fi on the forum OP - By no means do I expect anyone to use it :) but it was requested by travhill20		
	-Added some lines to the code to better integrate Hivers in the picking of colony fleets in NEX 
	-Added some code to better interact with NEX so that Hivers are more aggressive in invading the sector (you have been warned) - Ty so much Histidine for all your help!
	-Added new custom greetings when a player encounters a Hiver fleet or attempts to interact with a Hiver planet
	-Increased the range of the Krrakt Thermionic Hyper-Exiter PD from 350 to 400 - minor range increase to make it more competitive
	-Increase the speed of the Istkrrtc-type Hive from 225 to 325 - Allows it a better chance of reaching it's target
	-Increased the armor of the Scorpifly heavy drone from 325 to 450 - With it being unshielded this change will allow it to survive a little longer vs PD weapons
	-Added the Cerambycidae to the Hiver blueprint - Was incorrectly added to the high tech bp by mistake
	-Removed entries in unused columns on the ship hulls - Just removing some bloat that I though was needed when I started the project
	-Removed the nanoforge from each instance of light industry on Hiver planets - Learned that it was unneeded when fixing JYD so another small bloat removal
	-Changed the instructions on the forum OP on how to make the Hiver faction playable - The code changes made the previous way obsolete

v0.95 Save Game compatible with version 0.9
	-Replaced the Hiver crest graphic with a better quality one
	-Received some requests to add more Hiver ship graphics to the alternate ship pack so I made replacements for the Aphid, Chrysopidae, Lacewing, and Lucanidae
	-Replaced the ship sprite for the Cleridae freighter with a cleaner version - Same graphic just less saturated
	-Replaced the ship sprite for the Viridula tanker with a less blurry version - Darker tint with some minor changes
	-Added a new Super Freighter to the Hiver lineup, the Chalcosoma - With the new colony added in 0.9 I felt they needed a large well defended freighter for their long distance trade fleets
	-Added a new Super Tanker to the Hiver lineup, the Cerambycidae - Same reason as above but for fuel
	-Added a new small energy weapon to the Hiver lineup, the Krrakt Thermionic Exiter and gave it a custom shot
		-Based of the vanilla IR pulse laser but does 10 more damage per shot, has a longer range of 700, a higher energy per shot of 70 and an additional chargedown of 0.1
	-Replaced every vanilla IR pulse laser equipped on all Hiver ship variants with the new Krrakt Thermionic Exiter
	-Changed the projectile of the Krrakt Thermionic Hyper-Exiter PD to the new custom shot I made for the Krrakt Thermionic Exiter
	-Added a glow effect to the Krrakt Thermionic Hyper-Exiter PD	
	-Added a turret image and glow effect to the Krrakt Thermionic Hyper-Exiter PD - The base image was a bit too large for a turret mount
	-Added a glow effect to the Svrerresh Bio-Plasmic Launcher and gave it a custom shot - Previously used the vanilla pulse laser shot
	-Added a glow effect to the Sverrtrrsx Bio-Plasmic Caster
	-Added a glow effect to the Xhezek Thermionic Sling - seeing a pattern here yet :)
	-Fixed and error in the Hiver weapons to prioritize - Added a missing entry for the Ezkepren-type Hive torpedo
	-Added turret mount images to the Deathfly and sharpened it up a little, also added missing Biological Hull mod - Just cleaning it up a little and noticed the missing hull mod
	-Added turret mount images to the Princess and sharpened it up, also added two missing small weapons on the variant 
	-Fixed and error with the Scarabaeus not being added to the Hiver medium blueprint
	-Added the four new replacement ship sprites to the side by side comparison image on the forum OP
	-Re-made the ship sprite image on forum OP - replaced the above changed images and added the two new logistics ships(bottom of the image)- The old image was being cropped on smaller monitors
	-Added a Hiver emoji to the SS discord, you can now show your love Hiver style - Ty to Timid for suggesting it and Avanitia for adding it!

v0.9 - Save Game compatible however I recommend a new game since the new system requires a new game start to appear - Also, if you currently have any of the ships listed below in your save game fleet, you may need to refit them
	-Increased the % that the Biological Hullmod will kick in from 75% to 90% - Received some feedback that it needed a tweak
	-Added a new Hiver system; Rizdet is located on the map at the diametrical opposite of the other Hiver systems which should force Hiver fleets to travel the map to reach each other but still far away from normal traffic
	-Added yet more code flags to make Hivers aggressively hostile - An ongoing process that I am sure I'll nail down eventually :)
	-Increased the supply use and deployment points of the cruisers Prince, Catcher and Eyes from 15 to 20 - Brings them in line with other cruisers
	-Changed the loadout of the Scarab by removing it's offensive missile mounts and replacing them with more small turrets for defense - it is a freighter after all	
	-Increased the OP and the flux on the Eyes phase cruiser and added a second medium turret to bring it more in line with similar ships
	-Added a new logistics cruiser, the Ceruchus is well defended with PD mounts and equipped with a salvage & survey suite - Their fleet lacked these logistics - Essentially a heavy Apogee 
	-Added a new destroyer, the Scarabaeus is primarily an energy weapon powerhouse for it's size - Essentially a beefier Sunder - The Hiver midweight class was lacking  
	-Updated the sprite for the Emperor - Same graphic just less saturated
	-Replaced the sprite of the Twinblaster weapon - the previous sprite was a blurry mess
	-Updated the sprite for the Twinpd weapon - Same graphic, just darkened a little 	
	-Replaced the graphic used for the Scarab - Replacing one of my early blown up blurry messes, I swear I'll get them all eventually :)
	-The above graphic changes and additions are reflected on the Forum OP picture
	-Added a secondary RAR file to the download called "Replacement Ships.rar" that when extracted over the base mod will replace 11 pixel and data files for the biological looking ships (see below)
		-This is a request I have received from several players and the number one complaint regarding the "bug" sprites that I see on discord
		-The added RAR makes no other changes to the mod and can be ignored if you want to keep the original sprites
		-The replaced ships are the Beetle, Calopteryx, Crabby, Eyes, Flyter, Moth, Prince, Scorpifly, Snipper, Swimmer and the Viridula - Added a graphic to the mod main page showing the side by side differences
		-To enable all these changes, first install the base mod then open the "Replacement Ships.rar" (found in the Hiver Swarm base folder) and extract to your mod folder (same as any other mod)and accept overwritten files
		-To replace only some of the old sprites then install the mod as above but extract the "Replacement Ships.rar" to a dummy folder. Select the files for hull, variant and ship graphic you want and drag these to your HIVER folder and overwrite
		-To revert back to the original sprites, delete the HIVER mod from your mod folder and extract the base Hiver RAR to your mod folder. You can ignore or delete the Replacement Ships.rar file

v0.85a - Save Compatible from 0.85
	-Raised the break point of all Hiver ships to 60% for the smaller up to 90% for the larger to make them less recoverable
	-Raised the base cost of all Hiver assets by ~25% to make them more of a prize and more expensive to rebuild- TY vcuaoiwk for this and the above idea idea
	-A code update to fix a compatibility crash when using Linux - TY Phantasia for brining this to my attention	

v0.85 - 0.8 Save Compatible however most changes require a new sector generation and will only take effect on a new game 
	-Tagged all Hiver ships to no longer be able to be spit out by the machine god during an Industrial Evolution sacrifice event - Big thanks to SirHartly for adding a tag to allow this - will take effect on the next Indi Evo update
	-Reviewed every major modded faction config and set Hivers to a higher percentage to be picked for colony evaluation - Best I can do to force them to be picked other than writing my own custom colony code (sadly way beyond my abilities) 
	-Increased the distance Hiver fleets can travel to find a colony planet - Should cover the map
	-Installed Alpha Cores to run all Hiver Star Fortresses - Being a high tech civilization it is on brand plus it gives their planetary defense a little more teeth
	-Tweaked the Hiver planets to produce more fuel - Fuel was a limiting factor in their production of ships and fleets, this will hopefully increase their Invasion and Colony fleets in campaign mode
	-Increased the Hiver invasion chance a little to spur their growth
	-Increased the size of Hiver invasion and vengeance fleets - Makes them more of a threat
	-Added the tag that if the Hivers are used in Random mode they will get a bonus Orbital Works and Fuel production to give them a decent start in that mode  
	-Fixed an issue with the Zesketet background image causing a crash. - Essentially I changed the name of the sector but not the image - Ty to Omega_DarkPotato for the crash report

v0.8
	-Added Version Checker integration
	-Renamed Homehive to a Hiver name - Will only effect new games since SS only assigns system names at game creation
	-Hiver ships are no longer searchable in the codex - TY gentulf for this and the above suggestions
	-Added a Industrial Evolution black list making HIVER assets not available at the requisitions center industry 
	-Added a Blacklist to exclude all Hiver ships, weapons and wings from SCY's Amity's Freeport discount trader
	-Added the ability for all Hiver missiles to be immune to Diable Avionics' Derecho ECM system - see below
	-Added the ability for all Hiver missiles to be immune to Arma Armatura's Karma hacking - I feel that Hiver weapons are too alien to be effected by these two mod's abilities
	-Changed Hiver relationship status to all from Hostile to Vengeful - enter their systems at your own risk!
	-Changed the ship system of the Queen to Targeting Feed  -More in line with the Queen being a back line command ship
	-Changed the ship system of the Calopteryx to Recall device - More in line with the Calopteryx being a highly mobile strike carrier  - TY to grinningsphinx for this and the above suggestions
	-Changed the weapon type of the Calopteryx from energy to synergy and added Expanded missile racks as a built in mod. Also reset the Standard refit to reflect these changes - Gives it more flexibility
	-Changed all ship weapon mounts from hidden to shown (Turret & Hardpoint). TY Namesarethings for brining this discord discussion to my attention and guiding my research into the topic
		Did this for three reasons:
		1) As hidden mounts they could not be disabled which made them a little too hard to overcome
		2) By converting some of the hidden mounts to hardpoints they gained the benefit of having lower recoil 
		3) What self respecting cyborg wouldn't want to show off it's shiny?
	
v0.75
	-Added a blacklist for the Hivers that exempts the Hivers adjusting reputation if a player uses the Ruthless Sector mod
	-Added more AI tags to the faction ID that limit their chances of showing up on missions 
	-Added all their weapons and ships to a blacklist preventing them from showing up at the Prism Freeport
	-Added HIVER to a faction blacklist preventing them from interacting with Varya Bounties
	-Configured all options for HIVER to flag false under the conditions for bar events when a player has the Starship Legends mod

v07a - quick hot fix - 0.7 save game compatible
	-Re-drew the boundaries on all Hiver hulls - Read a comment on discord that if player owned Hiver ships with hidden weapon mounts are equipped with non-Hiver weapons there is a small chance it may go out of bounds and cause a crash. 

v0.7 Save Game Compatible - New game start needed for rep level changes see below
	-Lowered the starting and max possible relationship with Hivers to Vengeful - Essentially they hate you personally now and will do so to perpetuity - **This will only take effect on new game starts**
		Reason: Read a couple comments of players "working the system" and making them trade partners which is very op since their economy is very strong and not on brand
	-After some testing I decided to increase the dps of the Twin Blaster from 300 to 600 and energy per shot from 95 to 85 - it is essentially two medium pulse lasses (300 dmg and 40 energy) on a large mount
	-After some consultation with Histidine, I increased the range that Hivers will look for colony planets - This will help but overall it is a matter of how many faction mods installed that determines colony change %
	-Upgraded the Hornet's ground support to advanced groud support - ty to grinningsphinx for the suggestion
	-Increased the break probability of all the unarmored living ship variety of Hiver (Calopteryx, Crabby, Eyes, Moth, Prince, Snipper) to make them less recoverable
	-Removed the above list from the Industrial Evolution whitelist which disables them from being reverse engineered
	-Lowered the deployment points of the Emperor from 90 to 70 -It's dps was lowered by fixing the OP error on the Twin Blaster so it seems more balanced
	-Added a new torpedo weapon- grinningsphinx pointed out that the Hiver bomber was underpowered with the MIRV plus they lacked a torpedo so voila here it is!
	-Replaced the MIRV with the new torpedo on the Gnawler bomber drone and reduced the wing count from 2 to 1
	-Increased the EMP damage on the two plasma weapons - 100 to 125 and 200 to 250 respectively
	-Swapped out missile mounts on some of the ship variants with the new torpedo mount
	-Renamed all Hiver weapons and added custom description as wrote by grinningsphinx - At this point thank you just does not seem enough for all his efforts for this mod but TY just the same :)	
	
v0.6
	-Changed the faction colony behavior based on feedback. They will now look for standard colony planets instead of industrial and I increased their chance to send a fleet from 1 to 1.5 -let me know if you see a difference
	-After reading numerous discord comments about the Twin Blaster being overpowered, I looked over the code and realized I made a typo and fixed it 
		The charge up and charge down were set to 0.05 instead of 0.5. I intended it to be 300 dps not 3000, my bad
	-Changed the graphics of the two beetle ships adapting Protonus's designs after receiving a private messages that they were too disturbing and reading discord comments that they were too different from the other ships
		FYI: the Emperor is also a Prontus adaptation so he's not so lonely now :)
	-The Cleridae has been redesigned from a frigate to a destroyer and to not only be a tug for the Hivers but also a good small pd ship which they lacked and is now armed with 7 pd mounts and 1 small missile
	-Added 2 small hard point missile mounts to the Scarab giving it a bit more teeth 
	-Replaced the graphics of the two beetle ships with the new ones on the picture posed in the OP
	-Fixed some code and naming left over from when the Hivers were part of my JYD mod
	-Took a posted suggestion from Tipnick on my JYD mod and going forward the mod tab and RAR updates will have version numbers
	-Added text descriptions to all the Hiver weapons, ships and drones. Not my best work but I banged it out this morning for this patch, I'll probably update them later - Feel free to give me suggestions!
		At least there is no more lazy boilerplate "Very little is known about Hiver ships. They are bio-cybernetic in nature featuring high tech weapons and living heavy armor." :)
	
v0.55 oopise edition
	-Quick hotfix: 
		Essentially I accidentally assigned JYD SRM missiles instead of HIVER MIRV missiles on the new Scorpifly drone (fixed) and it you do not have JYD installed it would kick a fit - ty Futanagatari!	
v0.5
	-Added a new heavy drone - the Scorpifly is a heavily armored drone equipped with 2 MIRV missile launchers, 1 Spitter and 1 Twin PD - TY grinningsphinx for the collaboration and great name!
	-Added a new large Drone Tender - the Lucanidae is heavily armed and comes pre equipped with 6 drones including 2 of the new Scorpifly Heavy Drone - you have been warned
	-Fixed the AI tags for the HIVER wings, they should fight more intelligently now
	-Added 2 new ships that fill in missing utility ships for people who play as HIVERS:
		small tanker - the Viridula  - I'm pretty happy with the kitbash, hope you like it
		small combat freighter - the Silverfish - a beefier analogue of the hound but high tech with weak shields
	-Increased the fuel capacity of the Swimmer to 1400 and designated it as a medium/large tanker
	-Increased the range of the Spitter from 750 to 800
	-Added a Cryosanctum to Chozanti to supply Harvested Organs to the Hivers
	-Removed Harvested Organs from illegal wares and added Hand Weapons - They do not have hands after all :)
	-Increased the % that the Biological Hull hull Mod kicks in from 50% to 75% - Ty grinningsphinx for that last minute callout
	-Added the Biological Hull hull mod to all HIVER fighters and drones - sort of of an oversight I fixed when I was tinkering with it
	-Added images of the three new ships and the new heavy drone to the op link

V0.45
	-Reworked the HIVER economy to be less cheatery by limiting industries to standard and adding an additional settled planet to each system to compensate - TY MapleDaddy__ TTV for the suggestion.
	-Added new patrol fleets to each HIVER system to cover some blind spots
	-Added a mine laying system to the Beetle - Ty grinningsphinx for the idea to add Hive mines :)
	-Added an emp system to the Snipper making it a more effective pd ship
	-Adjusted the Queen's standard variant to use all its OP
	-Reworked the ship systems of several ships. They can now do more than microburn and high energy focus. TY grinningsphinx for the suggestion
	-Changed the Crabby to a Phase Destroyer
	-Changed the Eyes to a Phase Cruiser - It's eyes now glow in the dark oOoOoOooo spooky!
	-Changed the weapons on the Katydid to be more in line with Hiver high tech
	-Added a new troop transport ship the Hornet - TY grinningsphinx again for the suggestion, hope you like it I'm pretty happy with the kitbash
	-Added a new Tug utility ship the Cleridae
	-Added images of the Hornet and Cleridae to the op link (bottom) - The two beetles are holding hands how cute :)

v0.4
	-Fixed a typo with the long range blaster. Now uses 175 flux per shot - TY grinningsphinx for pointing out that OP mistake :)
	-Added a new Heavy Cruiser, the Princess. Heavy armor and hull with 2 small missiles as well as 5 medium and 3 small energy mounts
	-Added image of the princess to the op link (bottom)
	
v0.35
   -Made changes and tested to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Starsector
   -Fixed an error in the starting blueprints graphics when you flag them as playable
   -Added 16 Hiver player portraits that the player can enable if they choose to make them playable - see forum OP for instructions
   -Added two Hiver specific interaction images for their planets
   -Each Hiver planet now has a market that will only sell Hiver ships
   -Hiver Military markets sell Hiver weapons as well as other Corvus energy and missile weapons
   -Added detailed instructions on how to make them playable to the forum page
   -Hiver ships will now remain in dark running even if you are commissioned with them
   -Lowered the price of the Chrysopidae and changed the class from destroyer to heavy frigate
   -Increased the size of the Crabby and Deathfly to be more in line with other destroyer hulls

v0.3
	-Added 5 new Hiver specific BP packages that can be found when looting any area a BP pack can be found, for example a research station
	-Added the new BP packs as start items if you enable the mod to be playable 
	-Added some functionality code to the Hiver wing AI 
	-Fixed a mistake with the Scarab being accidentally flagged as a JYD ship
	-Ran a spell check on every text file and fixed several errors in spelling/grammar

v0.25
	-All Hiver weapons and Ships are now blacklisted for the Prism Freeport and will not show up for sale

v0.2 New Game Required
	-Added new hull - Scarab - Medium Freighter
	-Greatly increased the credit value of Hiver weapons as a reward for salvaging them (assuming you do not use them)
	-Reworked initial Hiver system to be more self sufficient
	-Added a secondary Hiver system for inter faction trade
	-Increased patrols in both Hiver systems
	-Set Player relations to Inhospitable (just a little above hostile) - you can visit their systems and view their assets but one wrong move....

v0.1
	- Initial release for review, testing and constructive criticism.
