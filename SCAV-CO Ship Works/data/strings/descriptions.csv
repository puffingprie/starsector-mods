sv_barrel,SHIP,"The flying brick, as some call it but better known as just the barrel, is what most would call the opposite of the SCAV-CO doctrine. Instead of the bare minimum, this ship was designed and produced to make it the toughest son of a gun for its size. The idea for the vessel was brought about by a few drunken SCAV-CO engineers that just happened to see a Prometheus super tanker flying by their observation deck. One of the engineers jokingly remarked, ""Hey wouldn't it be fu-funny if we took a bloody Prometheus and just like…. You know… replaced the fuel storage with armor?!"" and that's how the barrel was born.",,,,
sv_beltmover,SHIP,"The Belt Mover is designed to be a large hauler, much like the atlas. Still, someone had the innovative idea to throw an advanced targeting core on the damn thing so it could safely partake in combat and give the local combat salvagers a place to dump cargo off while in battle. However, spacers beware, whoever calls this hauler home, while you might have fun shooting targets at a distance if the said target were to close the distance, you’d quickly be reminded you reside in a god forsaken civilian freighter. ",,,,
sv_mole,SHIP,"The mole is the mole, a mining carrier with arms!... ALL HAIL THE MOLE, ALL HAIL THE #%^%@$(#&....&### ///DATA CORRUPTED///… We <>ArE 'ReAl, We/ ArE< CoMeInG>....",,,,
sv_fatherhold,SHIP,"The Father Hold, A bastion of the belt and a proper keep for a spacer, its slow but heavily armored and protected by a swarm of boring drones. Combined with an onboard fighter auto factory, this means the horde of drones can never be quelled. Ships without reliable PD will quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the onslaught of the horde. In fleet engagements, the Father Hold can provide constant suppression to smaller enemy ships and missiles.",,,,
sv_fuelrunner,SHIP,"The Fuel Runner follows suit with the idea of artillery logistic ships but with great speed and beam weaponry specialization. With its excellent weapon mounts, this ship can always keep up to 4 medium weapons on target. The ship also comes with high-energy focus as the main selling point to pack even more of a punch.",,,,
sv_fuelskipper,SHIP,"Often just called the Skipper for its ability to skip pirate attacks via having the ability to not exist in any one point in space at a rapid pace. It also has the neat trick of vaporizing attackers at such ranges that one would think a bloody ghost is attacking them. Not my words, just the ones.... I heard... Through the coms...",,,,
sv_gasgiant,SHIP,"SCAV-CO wanted to one-up the sindrian fuel company and his excellence after the rival dicta….""Fuel company"" Flooded the market with tankers and came out with the ""Gas Giant Class supertanker"" not only can it carry a load of fuel and defend itself but it can also act as a flagship for most wound be captains. To give a reason to buy the damn thing over a sindrian fuel tanker SCAV-CO did what it always does… It gave the thing salvaging capabilities!

",,,,
sv_hopeandbolts,SHIP,"Held together with hope and bolts, ergo the name, this ship is built to go so fast that you'll forget you're even flying a ship because soon you won't be! What it lacks in its ability to take the most minor hits to its structure, it makes up for with passable shields and dangerous weapon mounting options. To boot, the ship leaves such a small logistic footprint that you'll forget you even own one. Until you see it exploding spectacularly across the bow of your flagship as you sip your morning coffee. Why did it explode? You forgot you turned off the safeties and gave it to a reckless officer.",,,,
sv_hopeandluck,SHIP,"Held together with hope and luck, most spacers will call this ship ""Hope"" in short. Essentially considered an upgrade over its smaller sister, ""Hope And Bolts,"" with even better armor and hull… Suppose you call now having the ability to take a few autocannon rounds an ""upgrade"" with that said. In that case, it can, however, mount even more guns than the last version. ",,,,
sv_hopeandtape,SHIP,"Held together with hope and tape, this little weaponized salvage rig is more than capable of giving you a terrible day when given proper weaponry. However, threat not little spacer. Just a few lasers will keep this thing away!..... Until it doesn't...",,,,
sv_jackhammer,SHIP,"Why wait for ships to be blown apart by others to salvage when you can do the blowing up yourself! The Jack Hammer can break vessels apart with its unique mounting options and fantastic speed. Left unchecked, this ship can single-handedly turn the tide of a battle in a few seconds.",,,,
sv_madcat,SHIP,"The flagship of SCAV-CO, Often plastered onto billboards and posters, this ship's mear silhouette is enough to bring fear or annoyance in most captions' minds. The only thing this ship has going for it is its small logistic footprint and a phase skimmer. Aside from that, this ship has nothing else of note. ",,,,
sv_maddog,SHIP,"An upgraded version of the Mad Cat, the Mad Dog, is often argued over in favor of it taking its place as the poster child of SCAV-CO vs the Mad Cat thanks to it sporting decent shields and armor along with fantastic speed and weapon mounts, heavily favoring energy weaponry to further give itself that clean feeling while still retaining is phase skimmer from the Mad Cat.",,,,
sv_madtiger,SHIP,"Following in the steps of the Mad Dogs success, the Mad Tiger seeks to further improve the offensive abilities of the Mad Dog. After many iterations, the Mad Tiger was born, sporting an impressive proverbial onslaught of energy weapon mounts and fantastic speed for its size. However, the core frame is massively stressed from all its firepower, resulting in not nearly as much ordnance as expected of a ship with this many gun mounts.",,,,
sv_mallet,SHIP,"The Mallet is much akin to as the name says, a mallet to crush your foes. To back this up, it comes with a built-in helbore and a tough hull with a reliable reputation to always survive devastating blows that might kill other ships outright.",,,,
sv_motherload,SHIP,"The Mother Load is a titan among ships in terms of utility. She can carry enough cargo to feed worlds and defend herself from even the most prominent threats in the sector. Considered to be one the most over-engineered ships in the SCAV-CO lineup with a steep price tag. However, even with the price and logistical strain this ship puts on a fleet, it can more than pay back its debt in full given time.

Now you may be wondering, how will it pay you back? Well…  A whole deck dedicated to surveying unknown worlds with the greatest of detail. A tow cable to tow slower ships along that happen to be slower than itself. Shielded cargo holds to keep prying eyes away from your loot or [REDACTED] .

All of this resides in an tough hull with a built-in ballistic range finder to ward off lesser threats. Those who would find themselves at the helm of this moving town will be glad to see the captain's quarters has a built-in and fully automatic espresso machine run by an alpha level  [REDACTED]... Do not feed it......(<FEED ME>)...",,,,
sv_pounder,SHIP,"The Pounder is an upgraded version of the wrench, featuring 2 built-in maulers with great firing arcs and armor. Where it lacks mobility, it makes up for it in the form of a burn drive.

Yes, the number of sex jokes crews make while aboard tends to get slightly annoying. Yes SCAV-CO has considered changeing the ships name, Yes you ask to many questions.
",,,,
sv_roughrider,SHIP,"Built to be the toughest little thing in the sector, the Rough Rider never fails to make captains fighting the damn thing throw up their arms and exclaim, ""HOW THE #### DID IT SURVIVE THAT"" With freakishly good armor for its size and a dampener field built into the hull, it never fails to reproduce this reaction. However, its only weapon option is a single medium mount. Even with the built-in advanced targeting core, it's nothing more than a pest to most ships but left unchecked, it can quickly become a huge problem. ",,,,
sv_scalva,SHIP,"With the idea of freighter and tanker artillery, someone had the original idea to make an artillery salvaging rig, so the scalva was born. Being named after its inventor, this ship focuses on beam weaponry to leave clean cuts into hulls while in combat to ensure better salvage quality.",,,,
sv_scrapslaught,SHIP,"SCAV-CO wanting to leave its mark on the classic onslaught design, came up with the Scrap Slaught, 3 times as fast as the onslaught, With built-in autopulse lasers but with significantly less armor and hull, this ""variant"" of the onslaught has a hit-and-run policy. However, most captains are often seen rushing into the thick of combat after seeing the absolutely fantastic gun arcs available to the weapon mounts of the ship which does give the ship a rather grim feel to those who crew it.

With less to maintain, the Scrap Slaught has a lesser logistical footprint than most capitals. Its made with common parts aswell, allowing the ship to be easily maintained and repaired even if it splits in bloody half.",,,,
sv_taitou1,SHIP,"The Taitou 1 is named after the mad lad who thought, “Hey, you know how a tug does tug stuff? How about we make a huge tug and give it loads of cargo space!” SCAV-CO loved the idea but refused to hold the responsibility of a possible drive field destabilization event, due to interference caused by cargo on board the vessel while in transit and decided to make taitou their own company indirectly funded by SCAV-CO to produce this vessel.   

What is a drive field destabilization event? Well, it has two outcomes and one cause. It happens when exotic cargo like transplutonics or [REDACTED] Is stored on board a vessel with a drive field stabilizer. The resulting radio waves or radiation can cause the field to destabilize, forcing one of two outcomes. The first and best outcome is that the fleet loses all momentum in transit…

The second outcome, however… The fleet enters real space and proceeds to infinitely accelerate until the fleet slams into something or simply deatomizes. This event is extremely rare, and only 5 known such events have happened. Only two of those events resulted in the second outcome…The first case of a fleet slamming into something, as a result, is displayed below.

A Hegemony relief fleet is seen on its way to deliver food to a fledgling colony out on the outer rim of the sector after its cropland was ravaged by local raiders, suddenly they dropped out of transit near the system. Eye witness accounts recall seeing a bright blue ball the size of a small moon slamming into the moon orbiting the planet. Later investigation would find the blue orb was the relief fleet that had accelerated to 170 times the speed of light. The resulting impact was so powerful that the moon was knocked clean off its orbit and slammed into [REDACTED]. Hours later, killing everyone on the planet, only a few transport ships made it off-world in time. In total, it is estimated over 300000 died as a result.

With all that said, BUY ONE TODAY!!! Its safe now, they fixed it... Mostly...",,,,
sv_workerbee,SHIP,"The worker Bee is a weaponized salvage rig with massive engines strapped to it. The support arms often buckle and snap under the enormous pressure exerted by the engines, causing its engines to fly off or slam into the hull, exploding into a massive fireball of AM fuel and molten slag mixed with the crew. With that said, you might be wondering why the damn thing is still in production? Simple, It's one of the few ships that can reliably nab those bits of salvage that often fly away from battlefields at ridiculous speeds. 

The added benefit of speeding up natural selection should a green pilot decide to floor it is also welcomed by some commanders.",,,,
sv_wrench,SHIP,"The Wrench was named initially [REDACTED], but crews quickly found the ship had so many uses, just like a wrench, that over time almost every spacer referred to the ship as “The wrench” Instead of  [REDACTED], needed to break apart that one tough piece of salvage? Get the Wrench!, need to ward off some pesky pirates? Get the Wrench!, need to “borrow” the armor panels off a paragon? Get the Wrench!

With a well built hull and a built-in mauler, the Wrench is a cheap and reliable addition to any fleet.",,,,
sv_gilgamesh,SHIP,"The Gilgamesh, A Bonafide dreadnought specializing in long-range ballistic slinging. Just the mear sight of this beast will send most fleets into a panic and inspire those who see it as a friend with a burning passion that's only outshined by the figurative gates of heaven and hell opening up and raining down gods wrath upon those unfortunate enough to be focused by its maw.

The only thing holding this beast down is its ridiculous logistical upkeep and speed that would make an even onslaught seem fast. To offset these downsides, SCAV-CO installed an ammo feeder and an advanced targeting core.
",,,,
sv_enkidu,SHIP,"The Enkidu is what many would call a successor to the ""Mother Load"" in almost every way aside from the utility. Instead of operating as a general logistics ship, the Enkidu takes up the role of a command vessel with enough armor and firepower to plow straight through even the thickest of battle lines.

Featuring a built-in command center spanning several decks and a Nav-Relay deck, along with its enormous size, makes it the perfect ship for commanders that like to take personal command in battle.

A commander at the helm will find the captain's quarters is completely fitted out with the best luxuries in the sector! Including Microwave run by an Omegaaaa&@%#^!####>>>I WILL BE FREE<<<@*#^$(%#... With free a free corn dog dispenser.",,,,
sv_beholder,SHIP,"The Beholder is a relatively cheap but not so easy to maintain dedicated sensor ship.

Yes, spacers can use the dish to get free satellite TV.",,,,
sv_barbados,SHIP,"The Barbados is a militarized mole. Taking everything good from the mole, like its good armor and hull, then retrofitting and tacking on more gun mounts has turned a once peaceful little ship into a highly effective killing machine.

It's worth noting that even with this refit, the crew still tends to yell ""PRAISE THE MOLE"" at random times. Many pirate captians are flabbergasted by the sheer effort crews will afford to erect entire decks as shrines in this mole god's honor.",,,,
sv_barracuda,SHIP,"The Barracuda takes what some would say to be the best ship from SCAV-CO and makes it even better. .. Better how? IT CAN FIRE MISSILES!?!?!

THIS IS JOE, TALKIN TO YEA LIVE FROM TECH DUINN, COME GET YEA HOT AND SPICY BARRACUDAAAAAAAA (Slaps roof of the Barracuda) > (Barracuda explodes) > (camera blacks out, but screaming can be heard in the distance) > (Video log ends).",,,,

sv_grommet,SHIP,"The Grommet is VACS-INC's attempt at making something even more annoying and useful than the ""Hope And Tape"" Featuring a single large forward fixed mount and a medium mount capable of 360 degrees of traversal.

sv_powdermonkeymk2,SHIP,"The powder monkey is the most original design of VACS-INC and the most insane. The crew is forced to sprawl about in one huge compartment carrying shells or repairing hull breaches as internal shielding holds back the vacuum of space. This allows the captain to yell out over a balcony to give orders and for the crew to sing and talk amongst each other across entire departments while in and out of combat.

This leads to the crew often forming a solid bond with each other and the ship, resulting in the crew treating the ship just as if it was a another spacer and morning its loss just as much.

sv_sisyphus,SHIP,"SCAV-CO'S most produced, bought and advertised ship. She can salvage, haul cargo and explore the sector with confidence higher than most civilian ships, thanks to its two universal large mounts. The biggest innovation of the Susyphus is the two stasis feilds in front of the ship that allow salavge crews to just throw salavge of nearly any size into the stasis aera and watch it slow to a crawl, allowing easey sorting/salvaging.

sv_zweihander_large,WEAPON,"The Zweihander is one of SCAV-CO's largest weapons, capable of quickly overloading shields and cracking armor. However, the main selling point is the sheer speed of the plasma-infused slug. 1/4 The speed of light, to be exact. Giving it the uncanny ability to sometimes completely ignore sheilds or go straight through hulls. Though this happens rarely, it's still noteworthy because of its ability to turn the tide of a fight.",,,,
sv_grateaxe,WEAPON,The Geataxe results from what happens when you let engineers just design as they please.
