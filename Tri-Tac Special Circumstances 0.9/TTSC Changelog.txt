v0.8 - Save Compatible with v0.7
	-Changed the designation of the Escarpment to light cruiser carrier to reflect that is is not a pure light cruiser

	-Updated to 0.97a	

v0.6 - Save Compatible with v0.5
	-Added a NEX requirement to the forum OP - TY LeoSCfan for letting me know
	-Increased the damage of the TTSC short range laser from 40 to 45 and removed the chargeup time - Makes it more competitive for such a short range laser
	-Added a new weapon, the TTSC Twin Mining laser - TTSC lacked both a PD laser as well as a mining weapon and it fills a gap in being 2 OP which is rare for a PD laser weapon
	-Added a new frigate sized mining/salvage freighter, the Idiran - TTSC lacked some ships for their mining fleets so I added this as well as the next two to their lineup
	-Added a new destroyer sized mining/salvage freighter, the Gillan
	-Added a new cruiser sized mining/salvage freighter, the Azad - Decent cargo with strong mining stats and several small turrets which makes for a good deployable PD platform 
	-Added a new mining drone wing, the Rascal - Similar stats to the vanilla mining drone but 1 OP, 2 wing, equipped with 1 Twin Mining Laser with less armor and an omni shield

	-Increased the damage of TTSC Medium Range Laser from 75 to 85 - With the same OP as the TTSC Tactical laser it needed more DPS to make sense
	-Lowered the tier of the TTSC Medium and Long range lasers from 2 to 1 - Should allow them to show more frequently in TTSC markets
	-Increased the tier of the TTSC Tachyon Lance from 2 to 3 - As a high value weapon, tier 2 made it too available
	-Removed all TTSC weapons from the blueprint package 
	-Made a new BP for weapons that will not be in the player's starting cargo but discoverable - Received complaints that their "OP" weapons are too readily available

	-Changed the orbit of GSV Gobuchul Station to be a bit further out than SC Headquarters in Hybrasil - New sector generation only
	-Upgraded the station used on GSV Gobuchul Station to a Star Fortress - As a military station it needed more teeth - New sector generation only

v3.6 Quick hotfix - Save compatible with v3.5 Note: If you have a Latebricole in your fleet you will need to re-arm it
	-Fixed an issue with the Latebricole missing a collision radius and re-balanced it by replacing the medium turret with two smalls - TY LukeTasrook for bringing this issue to my attention
	-Redesigned the Latebricole to match the new weapon layout and replaced the sprite on the "All Ships Image" on the forum OP	

v0.3.5 Should be save compatible however you will have to rearm any Xenocrat ships in your fleet
	-Re-worked the sprite for the Xenocrat to better match 0.96a - TY to PigeonPun,Sorrydough, and my biggest discord fan ARandomRobloxJal for your helpful advice

	-Fixed an issue where the mod crashed when using Random Core Worlds in NEX - May break saves so save a copy of 0.3 just in case - ty eidolad for reporting the issue

v0.3 - 0.96a balance pass - Should be save compatible with v0.2.5 but not sure since I did not have a save game to test against

	-Increased the damage of the Heavy Burst Laser from 400 to 450
	-Lowered the range of the Interdiction beam from 1200 to 1000 and impact from 500 to 400 - Hard to balance this one since it is a vanilla weapon but not implemented

	-Removed the impact rating on the Plasma Beam
	-Added a missing zero to the cost of the Rift Beam and Rift Cascade Emitter to match the cost of their vanilla counterparts
	-Doubled the energy cost and damage output of the Rift lance - still half of the vanilla counterpart but makes it more desirable for a 9 op weapon
	-Lowered the damage of the Tactical laser from 85 to 75 - Puts in on par with it's vanilla counterpart
	-Lowered the range bonus on the hull mod OC Beams from 100 to 50 - AsinineMortal makes a good point that the range was a bit much when stacked with Advanced Optics
	-Lowered the max speed of all TTSC ships by 10% - AsinineMortal makes a good point that combined with their beam bonus and good shields their speed was making them a little too OP
