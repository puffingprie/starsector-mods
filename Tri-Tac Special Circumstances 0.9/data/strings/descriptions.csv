TTSC_caconyml,SHIP,"The Caconyml is the pinnacle of phase technology, with numerous weapon mounts it can dip in and out of reality delivering devastating amounts of damage before fading back into the n-dimension. With a wide coverage of small turret mounts it is well defended from missiles and fighters while it deals the pain.",Phase Capital,,
TTSC_cantankerous,SHIP,"Able to deal higher damage than the other cruisers in SC's fleet, the cantankerous is the primary ship to fly along side the capitals when approaching enemy lines.",Cruiser,,
TTSC_determinist,SHIP,With it's multiple weapon mounts the Determinist is easily configured to be a heavy hitter than can engage several smaller ships on it's own to tie them up while the rest of the fleet goes after the larger prey.,Battlecruiser,,
TTSC_empiricist,SHIP,The Empiricist is used by wolf pack admirals as their primary ship for capturing nodes and chasing down runners and with it's dual medium mounts it can punch above it's class as needed.,Frigate,,
TTSC_escarpment,SHIP,"The Escarpment is SCs Jack of all trades ship. Not being particularly strong as either a carrier or a cruiser, it can none the less fill in as either role as needed and that flexibility is it's primary strength.",Light Cruiser Carrier,,
TTSC_eschatologist,SHIP,"Tri-Tachyon uses the Odyssey as it's primary front line ship in their fleets. Special Circumstances, having need of a beefier ship, took the design and modified it and the Eschatologist is the end result. ",Battlecruiser,,
TTSC_excession,SHIP,The Excession is a fast-attack high-tech light cruiser designed to chase down runaways by trading armor for speed. The inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows it to make small dashes at high speed making it an excellent skirmisher.,Light Cruiser,,
TTSC_ghalssel,SHIP,"Special Circumstances needed a less fragile tanker for their wolf pack fleets so they retired the Dram in favor of the Ghalssel. By overhauling the frame, adding armor plating and larger capacitors it is far more capable and can be deployed in a support role when needed.",Combat Tanker,,
TTSC_gillan,SHIP,Special Circumstances uses the Gillan to mine resources in more dangerous areas and doubles as a destroyer sized salvage vessel.,Mining Freighter,,

TTSC_idiran,SHIP,The Idiran is a mainstay light escort in Special Circumstances' mining and salvage fleets. ,Mining Freighter,,
TTSC_ingenui,SHIP,"Special Circumstances uses the Ingenui for it's courier missions and when a subtle option is called for. With it's muffled engine signature and secret cargo compartments, it can stealthy complete SC's ""dirty tricks"" missions.",Combat Freighter,,
TTSC_jandraligeli,SHIP,A standard tanker for SC's exploration fleets with it's enhanced sensors and sturdier frame than other tankers of it's size the Jandraligeli is the go -to ship for extended fleet deployments.,Combat Tanker,,
TTSC_jernau,SHIP,Designed to look like an Atlas from a distance and giving the same emissions the Jernau is quite a surprise to any commerce raider who attempts to engage it. ,Combat Superfreighter,,
TTSC_kakistocrat,SHIP,The Kakistocrat is all about projecting the most firepower forward in the smallest package possible. ,Heavy Frigate,,
TTSC_kraiklyn,SHIP,Bristling with turrets the Kraiklyn is more cruiser than tanker. Sacrificing some of the fuel capacity of the Prometheus in order to make room for better capacitors and overall upgraded technology it can easily hold it's own if deployed in combat. ,Combat Tanker,,
TTSC_latebricole,SHIP,The Latebricole excels at approaching an enemy from multiple sides while weaving in and out of dimensions. Able to mount either missiles or lasers in it's front hard points it can be configured for multiple damage roles.,Phase Frigate,,

TTSC_revisionist,SHIP,"Camouflaged as the venerable Buffalo freighter, the Revisionist is anything but. With a robust flux capacitor and two medium turrets it can take down any wolf pack pirates that try to ambush it. Equipped with a shielded cargo hold and insulated engines it is the perfect ship to monitor patrols while you slide into stations that may or may not be friendly with your cargo.",Q Ship / Combat Freighter,,
TTSC_succour,SHIP, Special Circumstances heavily reinforced the Succour's hull to be is big bruiser front line ship. It can absorb damage while dealing it almost as good as a Capital ship but with a lower deployment cost. ,Heavy Cruiser,,
TTSC_ucalegon,SHIP,The Ucalegon is adept at  dealing multiple damage types with it's flexible mounts it weaves in and out of battle to deliver the blow from any angle. ,Phase Light Cruiser,,
TTSC_vescovo,SHIP,"With the Valkarye being too small and the Starliner being too fragile, SC found themselves in need of a hardier troop transport to support their assault missions. The Vescovo is able to carry two full platoons of marines along with their mechs and equipment and can withstand the fire of the heaviest station when making it's final run.",Assault Transport,,
TTSC_xenocrat,SHIP,"The Xenocrat is the heaviest ship in SC’s fleet lineup as well as being the most flexible. Able to wield either energy or missile weapons in every mount depending on the situation. Due to the expense of building and maintain this colossal ship, it is only used when absolutely needed. However when the time comes, just the appearance of this fearsome behemoth is enough to turn the tide of any battle.",Dreadnaught,,
,,,,,
TTSC_riptalon,SHIP,"Though only wielding one weapon, the Riptalon is aptly named as a full wing can tear away a target's shields at an alarming rate.",Fighter,,
TTSC_equator,SHIP,"More of a missile carrier than a standard bomber, the equator is used to strategically deplete an enemy's shields in advance of more armor and hull stripping wings.",Bomber,,

,,,,,
TTSC,FACTION,"No other part of Tri-Tachyon is more exactly represented what the corporation as a whole really stood for, or is more militant in the application of their policies. Yet no other part embodied less of the corporation’s day-to-day character. Special Circumstances is an organization focused on intelligence gathering, trade fleet military escort and mercenary work. They routinely turn away scores of even the best of the best and membership is by invitation only. This exclusivity combined with the often morally ambiguous or outright unsavory tactics they sometimes employ leads to a certain amount of negative feeling among average Corvus citizens.",,,
,,,,,
TTSC_pdburst,WEAPON,"Features a built-in capacitor that lets the weapon fire several bursts in quick succession if allowed to fully recharge. The q-switched gain medium is pulse pumped, ensuring that the power delivered to the titanium-doped sapphire gain medium peaks at a predefined interval. The result is a weapon that fires once every couple of seconds and is extremely effective for its size.",,,
TTSC_pdburst_fighter,WEAPON,A short-burst high-intensity laser with excellent performance and range. Recharge rate is reduced due to a smaller capacitor than standard models due to the light chassis mount requirements.,,,
TTSC_gravitonbeam,WEAPON,"An atypical beam weapon which is highly effective versus armor. Excellent range, but the damage per second ratio versus shields is sub-par.",,,
TTSC_guardian,WEAPON,"A collection of smaller lasers mounted together on a rotating pod, with a built-in capacitor allowing extremely high burst damage. A combination of an autonomous sub-gamma AI core for targeting and five separate carbon dioxide lasers make this weapon exceptionally effective and the dedicated rotator power supply makes target tracking almost instantaneous.",,,
TTSC_heavyburst,WEAPON,"An often underestimated weapon, the heavy burst laser is actually one of the best performing beam weapons available in the Sector. The physics that create the burst effect are not understood by the highest echelons of the Tri-Tachyon Hybrid Physics Division. It is theorized that a q-switched multi-phased beam could be shot through a quantum filter which would ensure entanglement and create a burst effect. This may be an explanation for the tripled lens housing, originally thought to be a failsafe system. But these are just theories. ",,,
TTSC_hil,WEAPON,"A long-range, high damage beam weapon, often mounted on support ships, or ships that need anti-shield capability on a budget. The extreme range at which targets can be tracked and destroyed makes it excel in safely providing close support to friendly ships that are engaged in a melee. It is a favored weapon of captains that can manage the flux cost associated with operating it.",,,
TTSC_interdictorbeam,WEAPON,An extended range beam that does little damage designed to push targets off course and deliver a constant EMP charge.,,,
TTSC_ionbeam,WEAPON,"A long-range support weapon, the Ion Beam is able to fire more and more disruptive EMP arcs through shields as the target's hard flux levels go up and devastates the hull if the target's armor is stripped. This charged energy weapon has sufficient range to be mounted on combat platforms expected to be placed behind rather than on the front line of combat for maximum efficiency of use.",,,
TTSC_lrpdlaser,WEAPON,A long range beam weapon that can be fired for extended periods. The extended range permits the otherwise low wattage to have a greater impact on the targets.,,,
TTSC_mininglaser,WEAPON,"A small laser designed for close range skirmishing ships, with great tracking capability, decent damage good flux efficiency it is hard to go wrong using this weapon.",,,
TTSC_pdlaser,WEAPON,"A cheap, short range laser that is good for brawling ships on a budget. Very flux efficient but also very short range.
",,,
TTSC_phasebeam,WEAPON,"This weapon is, at base, simply a laser beam with a tripled sapphire gain medium to ensure the highest possible weaponized wavelengths. A short-range, short-duration beam that causes heavy damage in a burst. Capable against armor, as far as beam weapons go.",,,
TTSC_plasma,WEAPON,"Plasma beams are related to graviton and phase beams, in that they use poorly-documented properties of brane physics to deliver their payloads. The weapon uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward resulting in a large, beam weapon that's one of the most devastating sustained damage-dealers in the Sector, provided the ship it's mounted on can handle the flux it generates.",,,
TTSC_riftbeam,WEAPON,"Creates space-time rifts along the beam length, targeted at nearby enemy ships. Each rift deals energy damage to nearby targets.",,,
TTSC_riftcascade,WEAPON,"Creates space-time rifts on impact. More rifts are spawned when the beam is fired at short range. Each rift deals energy damage to nearby targets, with successive rifts dealing more damage.",,,
TTSC_riftlance,WEAPON,"A mid-range, high damage but flux inefficient weapon good at depleting enemy shields.",,,
TTSC_tachyonlance,WEAPON,"A burst operated beam that delivers a devastating amount of damage to armor with a cascading EMP component. The EMP arcs have a chance to pass through shields based on the target's hard flux level. Unlike the beams fired from normal beam weapons, the tachyon stream is not lensed or altered in any way - in fact once the initial tachyon marker is actuated the reaction takes on a life of its own, rapidly consuming the power stored in the capacitors and unleashing destruction. When normal space is exposed to such high levels of anti-plasma, a combined electromagnetic, gravitic and thermal cavitation effect shreds anything that stands in its way, while also severely damaging nearby electronics equipment.",,,
TTSC_taclaser,WEAPON,"The workhorse of beam weapons in the sector, the tactical laser is useful at medium to long-ranges and especially effective against shielded targets. A good support weapon for small craft, especially in prolonged engagements due to it's flux efficiency.",,,
TTSC_twmininglaser,WEAPON,The Twin mining laser features two fluoride gas gain medium capacitors refitted for combat. The micro-asteroid targeting package has been repurposed to also track and target incoming missiles and fighters.,,,
,,,,,
TTSC_headquarters,CUSTOM,This station was formerly the stronghold base for the infamous pirates that once ruled the system prior to Tri-Tachyon taking it over. It has since been taken over by Tri-Tachyon as a combination ship-building factory and operations center to house the Intel and dirty tricks department of Tri-Tac known as Special Circumstances. SC is a secret service/black ops unit that fulfill the role when circumstances exceed the moral capacity of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation or where the situation is highly complex and requires highly specialized skills. It also serves as cut out subsection of the corporation that deals with outside agents or mercenaries in the employ of Special Circumstances.,,,
TTSC_hybrasil1_station,CUSTOM,"This GSV station of Special Circumstances acts as a combined sentinel for the nearby HQ as well as a trans-hub for the collection, smelting and processing of ore mined in the nearby belt. Limited goods and service as well as refit and repair facilities are available as well as bar featuring the local fare.",,,
TTSC_Magec_station,CUSTOM,This GSV station of Special Circumstances is a retired militarized command ship used during the Tri-Tachyon-Hegemony War. It acts as a satellite outpost but it's data banks are full of holograms of the whole Tri-Tachyon tech base containing all the knowledge and productive capacity needed to reconstruct the faction in case of catastrophe.,,,
