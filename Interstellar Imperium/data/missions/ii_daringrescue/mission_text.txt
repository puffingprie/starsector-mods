Location: On approach to the Imperial Embassy
Date: 202.08.22

For most of the cycle, the Hegemony blockaded the Yma system's outer jump points, preventing the Imperium's supply fleets to reach the Imperial Embassy. Months spent cut off from resupply threatened a collapse of the station's command structure, followed by inevitable decivilization.

Fearing that the Imperial Embassy would imminently fall, a contingent of elite Imperial Guard ships was dispatched from Babylon to spearhead a large relief caravan. Unfortunately, an enterprising spy reported this movement of forces to the High Hegemon, who immediately devised a plan to defeat the blockade-runners without committing to direct military action. Favors were called in, and certain Hegemony forces were withdrawn...

Upon arrival at Yma, the relief caravan encountered token resistance from the outmatched blockading forces. The enemy quickly retreated, offering the Imperial fleet a clear path to the Imperial Embassy. Although radio chatter from the station had gone dark, all seemed well as they approached, right until a large Pather fleet suddenly emerged from Huascar's shadow. Despite multiple attempts by the Imperium to hail the raiders, the only reply they received was a long-winded rant about the "apotheosis of the heretics' downfall." A fight was at hand.

Cut off from their destination and unable to escape, the unprepared convoy was given orders to ram through the Pather offense at all costs. The Clementia Omnis, a state-of-the-art Adamas-class phase cruiser, lit up boosters with her elite escorts, engaging the enemy head-on in a sudden and desperate bid to defeat the Luddic Path before either their elite-modded ships - or the embassy - could give out from exhaustion.
