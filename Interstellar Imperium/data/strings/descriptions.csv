ii_sledgegun,WEAPON,"Trading overall firepower for extreme range, this weapon is most effective when used in conjunction with larger fleet tactics. Ineffective against shields.

The Sledge Gun's creation was a miraculous feat of engineering, an effort that took nearly twenty cycles of concerted effort. In principle, it fires a molten projectile with volatile explosive properties at a high velocity with top-class accuracy, but the sheer tolerances involved in creating such a precise weapon were a showstopper. At last, after many failed attempts, it was discovered that just enough performance could be squeezed out of the domain autoforge system to make the Sledge Gun viable. Even after a successful production run, however, it quickly became apparent that mounting the weapon in any practical sense requires a significant investment of resources in stabilizers, targeting computers, and related equipment.

Despite these shortcomings, the Sledge Gun is still considered a top-class artillery weapon, valued for its ability to strike a target far beyond the range of anything else in its size class.",,,,
ii_sledgecannon,WEAPON,"The larger counterpart of the Sledge Gun, enjoying increased firepower and range. Most effective when used in conjunction with larger fleet tactics. Ineffective against shields.

The Sledge Cannon is an ambitious continuation of the Sledge Gun's design, taking the same design principles but scaling the weapon up to a new size class. The weapon's resulting effective range isn't just the best in its class, but possibly the best of any weapon in common use; in any engagement, a captain can rest assured that the Sledge Cannon will fire first.",,,,
ii_smallballista,WEAPON,"Fires an artillery missile with a two-stage propulsion system and a volatile warhead. Dangerous and hard to dodge when combined with conventional weapons. An integrated autoforge replenishes munitions over time.

Developed by the Interstellar Imperium as an alternative to the Pilum to fit a more aggressive, opportunistic style of combat, the Ballista LRM is designed to pelt the target with wide waves of fast rocket-like projectiles. Capable of occasionally slipping past shields and point defenses, especially if the target is under heavy pressure. The relatively fast and short-lived Ballista might have a long effective range, but it doesn't get a chance to try to hit the target again if it misses.",,,,

ii_pulsar,WEAPON,"An unconventional assault weapon that fires bursts of volatile plasma. Flux-efficient and ruinous against exposed armor, but lacks range. Needs to recharge after a prolonged burst.

Crude but effective, pulsars are an ingenious design uniquely suited for Imperium warships. The pulsar's exceptional damage output would normally be offset by poor accuracy; the weapon is almost uncontrollable, even in the hands of a skilled gunner. Advanced Imperial fire control systems, however, are able to make the inhuman calculations necessary to establish firing solutions quickly enough to account for rapidly-changing variables. As a result, an otherwise niche weapon can be utilized to terrifying effect in the correct circumstances.

Pulsar weapons require additional space for thermal shielding and an armored magazine, making them relatively difficult to install on a warship given how simple the design is in practice. Despite this, they remain a popular choice of secondary - or even primary - weapon on specialist Imperium warships, and are always an useful deterrent against fighters and other foes that stray too close.",,,,
ii_pulsarrepeater,WEAPON,"An unconventional heavy assault weapon that fires a deadly stream of volatile plasma. Flux-efficient and ruinous against exposed armor, but lacks range. Nominally supports point defense duties.

The Pulsar Repeater represents only a slight variation upon the smaller Pulsar design, using a large internal magazine and multiple firing chambers in order to preserve peak output for much longer. It may not be a flashy weapon, but it is certainly an effective one, given the right circumstances.

ii_heavypulsar,WEAPON,"An unconventional tactical assault weapon that fires bursts of volatile plasma. Fairly flux-efficient and ruinous against exposed armor. Needs to recharge after a prolonged burst.

The Heavy Pulsar is a more advanced variation of the standard Pulsar, and the technology to miniaturize it to a small slot size does not yet exist. Compared to the standard variety, this weapon is more powerful and less unpredictable, making it useful at longer ranges. Still, it's not exactly an artillery weapon, and the Pulsar's notoriously unsustainable output is only partially mitigated by the increased magazine.

ii_sagittarius,WEAPON,"A jack-of-all-trades autogun, the Sagittarius is particularly effective against fighters and exposed hull, but also works reasonably well against shields and can even act as a crude PD system in emergencies. Accuracy starts excellent, but quickly drops off.

Developed to compensate for the lack of available slots on some Imperium ships, the Sagittarius Autogun covers as many roles as possible. While it lacks a true niche (beyond fragging a ship whose defenses are already stripped away), this weapon is a rather safe choice due to its wide applicability and reasonable mounting requirements.",,,,
ii_javelinsingle,WEAPON,"The Javelin ASM is a heavy medium range anti-ship missile that trades speed for extreme durability. Slow and inevitable. This mounting contains a single missile.

The Javelin ASM is an offshoot of the Harpoon MRM, developed by Vulcan over a long period of iterative development. In its current form, it doesn't even resemble the original missile, but it paradoxically fulfills a similar role. While the original's fine attitude controls and powerful thrusters made it great at chasing down frigates, much of that speed was wasted against harder targets. The Javelin, on the other hand, boasts a much bigger warhead and enough ablative plating to be considered paranoid, a feature the Harpoon decidedly lacks.",,,,

ii_lux,WEAPON,"Small but fierce, the Lux Repeater is a premium anti-armor weapon boasting a desirable combination of range and burst damage.

The Lux Repeater was actually Justitia's idea, having requested a counterpart to the highly-respected needler weapons (allegedly for aesthetic purposes). Vulcan, as the stories go, begrudgingly acquiesced to Justitia's demands at the insistence of then-emperor Germanus, crafting a beautiful weapon of war to appease the mercurial goddess. The result is the Lux Repeater, a somewhat impractical but admittedly powerful weapon that achieves its aesthetic goals. Best used in situations where a lot of power needs to be packed into a tightly limited number of slots.",,,,
ii_solis,WEAPON,"This weapon is a heavy twin-linked cannon, adept at cracking holes through armor with tightly-grouped high-explosive shells. Offers best-in-class performance normally associated with much larger weapons.

The Interstellar Imperium has been very secretive about the Solis Cannon's manufacturing process. One of the relatively few things known about it is that the majority of the development went into the ammunition, rather than the weapon itself. Solis shells are exceptionally explosive to a degree that shouldn't be possible, suggesting that some type of exotic material - perhaps antimatter - is utilized. As it stands, very few ships' armor can withstand a direct hit from this weapon. Evidently, this power comes at a cost: it's expensive and difficult to mount, largely due to the sophisticated munitions foundry built into the housing.",,,,
ii_telum,WEAPON,"This is a high-end kinetic weapon, capable of pressuring and overloading even the strongest shield systems. Individual shells are powerful enough to threaten weakened armor sections.

The Telum Autocannon fires shells at such a high velocity that repeated rounds would actually cause structural failure inside the weapon. To counteract this, the weapon uses a rotary triple-barrel system, making it larger and more mechanically complex than it might have otherwise been. Still, the Telum's performance is famously high, earning the weapon a reputation for overloading shields more reliably than any other.",,,,
ii_heavypulselaser,WEAPON,"An upgraded, overcharged variant of the Pulse Laser, this weapon trades efficiency for raw damage output. Good armor penetration and short-term shock capabilities, but usually can't be fired continuously.

The Heavy Pulse Laser is an appropriate name for a weapon that literally began from a reverse-engineered Pulse Laser blueprint. After undergoing a set of radical electrical changes and optimization efforts by the hand of Vulcan, this much deadlier weapon began to resemble a mixture of the Pulse Laser and the Heavy Blaster - stronger than the former but more efficient than the latter. A favorite of the Imperial Guard, as this weapon requires amazing reactor output to make full use of.",,,,
ii_fundae_s,WEAPON,"This pod launches a cluster of eight SRMs, with internal capacity for eight firing cycles. Fundae SRMs, while individually weak, are high-performance defensive missiles capable of dispatching fighters and other small craft with ease.

A wholesale replacement of the venerable Swarmer, this weapon system is a unique invention of the Imperium's greatest minds - namely, its three AI deities. Seeking a definitive trump card to be used against heavy carrier tactics (a notable counter to the Titan Planetbreaker), the Fundae is hyper-specialized for the task of destroying fighter craft. A general explosive warhead is augmented with a smart-fragmentation system that distributes flechettes optimally, while retaining excellent thruster performance for pursuit capability. However, the missile's small package leaves little for hardening; usefulness against warships is tempered by the ease by which a Fundae can be shot down by even the cheapest point defenses.

The Fundae remains the pre-eminent anti-fighter missile system in the Persean Sector, but tight manufacturing tolerances and a sophisticated loading system drives up cost and makes the launchers notoriously difficult to mount.",,,,
ii_fundae_m,WEAPON,"This pod launches a swarm of fourteen SRMs, with internal capacity for twelve firing cycles. Fundae SRMs, while individually weak, are high-performance defensive missiles capable of destroying fighters and other small craft with ease.

ii_onager,WEAPON,"This specialized launcher deploys a unique type of torpedo with an internal supply of thirty-six Fundae SRMs. In addition to being a top-class anti-fighter weapon by virtue of its submunitions, the Onager is a powerful anti-capital torpedo in its own right. Difficult to shoot down. Most effective against carriers.

The Onager MIRV is a very recent design, practically fresh off the manufactories of Nova Capitalis. The ultimate in anti-carrier technology, this weapon system delivers a one-two punch. First, a swarm of thirty-six Fundae SRMs are launched from the torpedo's internal housing as soon as either the carrier or its fighters draw near. Second, the torpedo proceeds to strike the carrier with a powerful high-explosive charge. Sustained Onager barrages can leave even the largest carriers completely drained of resources and vulnerable to a mop-up task force, such as a group of frigates and destroyers - or your own carriers.",,,,
ii_custos,WEAPON,"An all-business point defense beam specialized for anti-missile duty. Rips apart incoming ordnance with ruthless efficiency, but lacks the range to do much else. Also effective against unshielded, lightly-armored fighters.

This weapon was developed by the Imperium in the early days after the Collapse, closing a significant weakness on many of their hulls: poor point-defense coverage. Lacking the luxury of overlapping slots, particularly in the rear, the Custos Defender was created specifically to be as effective against missiles (and only missiles) as possible, thereby squeezing out the utmost performance in a limited space. Since then, the crude weapon was refined and made more efficient, but its characteristics have remained largely the same for nearly two centuries.",,,,
ii_particlegun,WEAPON,"A low-cost, low-performance point defense weapon. Surprisingly effective when deployed in large numbers.

The Particle Gun is a warship-grade conversion of a weapon system that appears on certain Imperium fighter chassis. Its low cost and excellent efficiency makes it suitable as ""slot-filler"", and it performs particularly well on Imperial ships with the ""Targeting Package"" suite of modifications. Brash commanders often make the mistake of ignoring this weapon, foolishly wasting precious ordnance on unnecessary high-end point defense systems when the lowly Particle Gun would do just fine.",,,,
ii_particlecannon,WEAPON,"An advanced tactical suppression cannon capable of chipping away at shields and shredding unprotected hull. Useful for general long-range attack capability, but excels at pressuring and finishing off damaged targets.

The Extended Range Particle Cannon is related to the Particle Gun in terms of physics principles, but is otherwise completely distinct as a weapon system. An advancement upon the Tactical Laser's combat role, this weapon is an important component of the Imperial arsenal. The ER Particle Cannon's primary purpose is to ""checkmate"" a weakened opponent by leveraging its range to force a choice between two fatal outcomes. Either the target can drop shields, in which case this weapon will make short work of the underlying hull; or the target can remain shielded, dooming itself to eventually being flux-locked and subsequently struck down.

The standard Particle Cannon was never put into production, given its poor performance in simulations. However, the ""Extended Range"" name stuck on the follow-up (much more successful) design.",,,,
ii_arcus,WEAPON,"This high-velocity autocannon trades overall kinetic damage output for improved efficiency. Ideal for ships with excess weapon slots. Fairly fast and accurate.

The Arcus Autocannon is a standard-issue Imperium retrofit, generally used in place of the Light Autocannon series of weapons. In Imperial design doctrine, warships generally have more weapon hardpoints than their reactors can sustainably support; this weapon attempts to remedy the situation by offering a low-yield, high-efficiency alternative. Some captains malign this weapon for its conservative design, but its reliability is begrudgingly respected even by such detractors.",,,,
ii_siegemortar,WEAPON,"This high-yield explosive weapon trades overall anti-armor damage output for improved efficiency. Ideal for ships with excess weapon slots. Long-ranged and excellent for cracking through armor, but very inaccurate.

The Siege Mortar is a standard-issue Imperium retrofit, generally used in place of the Light Assault Gun. Generally seen as a better fit for Imperial combat doctrine, this weapon is a high-efficiency alternative with better armor penetration but weaker attack pressure. Some captains consider the Siege Mortar's poor accuracy to be its Achilles' Heel, but others argue that it's only as accurate as it needs to be to get the job done.",,,,
ii_photonbeam,WEAPON,"A heavy long-range beam capable of extreme output, but for a very short burst. Blasts straight through armor and strains weaker shield systems. Requires special ammunition.

The Photon Beam Cannon - or PBC - is a siege-grade laser weapon with ludicrously high energy content, far exceeding any standard Domain equipment in peak output. Requiring massive internal capacitors and ungainly ultra-grade flux conduits, this weapon is impossible to be modularized; certain Imperial hulls are built around it, as a result.

The PBC produces a laser hot enough to potentially ignite atomic fusion, which poses certain challenges... as a result, the entire mid-weapon assembly is a heavily-shielded single-use gain medium, designed to be able to absorb all of the waste heat. This weapon's burst length is so short because this part of the weapon literally melts into a star-hot puddle of plasma, posing a physical limit on the beam's duration. After this happens, the gain medium - container and all - is quickly ejected into space so that a fresh one can be installed while the capacitors recharge. All told, the PBC is a marvel of weapons engineering.",,,,
ii_croceamors,WEAPON,"This spinal-mounted weapon is a powerful railgun that accelerates the projectile to relativistic speeds. Such extreme acceleration turns the projectile into a blob of plasma as a byproduct, making it function similarly to an energy weapon. Dangerous and difficult to avoid.

The Crocea Mors uses a unique two-stage acceleration mechanism, exploiting the Caesar's long hull to produce a higher muzzle velocity than just about anything else. The first stage is a classic electromagnetic matter accelerator, while the second stage exploits poorly-understood P-space physics to warp space-time as the projectile passes by, greatly magnifying the superconductor coils' effects like an EM-lens.

Minerva's first attempt at a final solution to the Imperium's tenuous position in the Persean Sector, the Crocea Mors didn't quite live up to expectations. While it is a very powerful weapon in space, the projectile is just not energetic enough to cause sufficiently dire damage on a planetary scale. The Titan, developed decades later, would eventually fill the shoes that the Crocea Mors failed to wear.",,,,
ii_gravitycannon,WEAPON,"This enormous and unusual beam weapon creates a powerful gravitic effect, shearing hull and pushing the target with great force.

So large and sophisticated is the Gravity Cannon that it cannot be mounted onto a starship; only a full orbital station can power such a device. With immense range, it is often used as a method to single out targets from a larger invading fleet by hurling them into space, away from their allies.",,,,
ii_photonblaster_left,WEAPON,"A product of the Adamas' unique power system, this blaster fires a steady cadence of supersaturated energy pulses. A straightforward - yet devastating - weapon.

The Photon Blaster was originally an afterthought, essentially a weaponized adaptation of the catalyzed containment field system integral to the Adamas' Lightspear. Relatively few modifications were needed in order to craft a terrifying weapon out of the otherwise innocuous CCFS. Early photon blaster tests yielded overwhelmingly positive results, prompting the final Adamas design's commitment to making the most out of them, leading to the Lux Finis's mode-shifting behavior.

While it is theoretically possible to create a modular variant of the photon blaster, Vulcan ultimately deemed such an endeavor to be too impractical to be worth the cost. This decision has been a matter of continuing debate within the Pantheon.",,,,

ii_lightspear,WEAPON,"The Adamas is constructed around this titanic beam weapon, and even then it must reconfigure its power system mid-combat in order to fire. After a charge-up sequence, this weapon does extremely heavy damage, sufficient to overpower and destroy smaller ships in a single stroke.

The fancifully-named Lightspear was dreamed up by the AI goddess Minerva and realized by her AI god counterpart, Vulcan. Essentially an incredibly power laser, its gain medium is a homogenous quantum-crystalline field, a concept whose properties were previously thought to be poorly understood. However it works, this weapon is demonstrably monstrous in both power and proportions, forever locked to the Adamas' unique design.

Completion of the Lightspear, despite widespread reports of the Adamas' problematic design cycle, continues to spawn rumors that the so-called Imperial Pantheon has already exceeded the Domain's mastery of technology. Such rumors are dismissed as baseless conjecture by both the Imperium and - surprisingly - the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.",,,,
ii_armageddon,WEAPON,"A self-replenishing launcher that fires waves of slow, swarming MRMs with erratic, unpredictable flight behavior. Ideal for pressuring and distracting a wide variety of targets.

The Apocalypse MRM uses a plethora of hard-coded and inefficient guidance algorithms in order to confuse the target's point defense systems, sacrificing speed for sheer suppression potential. The explosive payload is less than ideal, but nevertheless a large swarm of these missiles is a serious threat to any target. Many potential performance-enhancing modifications could conceivably be made to the Apocalypse MRM, but simplicity was prioritized and tolerances were slackened in order to better serve in-combat construction of replacement ordnance.",,,,
ii_triplepbc,WEAPON,"A heavy tri-linked beam weapon ideal for sustained pressure against smaller targets. Performs well against armor, unlike most beam weapons.

The Triplex Beam Cannon - or TBC - is an offshoot of the Photon Beam Cannon. Scaling the weapon up to a larger size was found to be impossible, so the PBC was actually downsized and duplicated, cramming three such weapons into one housing assembly. The result is an altogether weaker beam with less stringent power requirements and a reduced thermal load, allowing the three emitters to alternate for an overall rapid firing cycle.",,,,
ii_patella,WEAPON,"A steady-firing heavy EMP weapon, capable of ravaging even the most hardened subsystems without sacrificing raw damage output. Notoriously inefficient.

Based on the standard ion cannon found on many worlds, the Patella Breaker was designed from the ground up to complement the Maximus' combat role: a hard-hitting strike-disabler. The resulting design is not really transferable to a modular slot, but the resulting weapon outperforms even an ion pulser in sustained workloads.",,,,
ii_titan_w,WEAPON,"This is the Imperium's final trump card, singularly responsible for their continued existence outside of the Domain's AI laws: mutually assured destruction. A strategic weapon like no other, the Titan's destructive power vastly exceeds any other shipborne weapon system. In its base configuration, the Titan's blast wave can consume nearly an entire battlefield.

The Titan Project is the brainchild of Minerva and Vulcan, two deific AI entities with broad reign over most of the Interstellar Imperium. Seeking a way to prevent the Imperium's downfall - and with it, their destruction - the pair set out to forge a superweapon that could hold the Hegemony at bay. Owing to decades of relatively unopposed buildup during the First AI War, the Imperium ultimately succeeded, creating a warhead with a destructive yield within spitting distance of an original Domain-manufactured planetkiller.

Further enhancements to the Titan resulted in its integration into a cruiser-sized missile, and eventually the creation of a purpose-built ship to house it: the Olympus-class. The ease of delivery and, more importantly, manufacturing accessibility resulted in an unprecedented tipping of the scale, credited with single-handedly forestalling a brutal Hegemony crackdown on the burgeoning Interstellar Imperium. Despite the gross impracticalities of actually fielding enough Titans to beat back the Hegemony, the mere threat that the Imperium could, in fact, burn a large fraction of the sector's populated worlds with their current arsenal has forced a tenuous stalemate.

Other variations upon the Titan have been experimented with, but the original Titan Planetbreaker is a device mimicking the behavior of a starship's power core. Even the radiance of a Paragon's destruction, however, is merely a candle to the Titan's bonfire: once the warhead is primed, a series of unshielded phase coils is activated in precisely the correct sequence to trigger a reality disruption event. Compounding the detonation of the core with the power amplification effect caused by an exponential time-factor increase, the resulting instantaneous energy output is sufficient to rip apart the vacuum itself. An enormously large amount of energy is thus released, converting the Titan into exotic matter and raising the temperature of nearby material far beyond that of the core of a star. In short, it can melt a continent. Notably, shield and phase systems are insufficient to protect against the initial blast.",,,,

ii_fundae_mirv,WEAPON,"Fires endless waves of fast, swarming MRMs that chew through fighters with ease.",,,,
ii_magna_fulmen,WEAPON,"The Libritor is built around this spinal-mounted weapon: a long-range energy projector with top-rate striking power. While the standard firing cycle is lengthy, banks of reserve capacitors built into the hull (the Arbalest Loader system) keep the Magna Fulmen ready to go at a moment's notice.

With the Magna Fulmen bears a similar tactical profile to the Crocea Mors, they operate on entirely different technologies. Developed much later than the Caesar's spinal gun, the Magna Fulmen is a pure directed energy weapon that feeds directly from the Libritor's reactor for power. At the moment of firing, so much energy is released instantaneously that it arcs through the vacuum of space, creating lightning from trace gases escaping from the ship's thrusters.

The Magna Fulmen has a wide range of variants, swapped out at the drydock as part of an Imperial Package installation. Some of these variants are dual-mode, offering more tactical options in battle at the cost of a more complicated capacitor arrangement.",,,,

ii_basileus,SHIP,"Rotund and spacious, the Basileus-class trades grace for unmatched firepower. With missiles payload that can top out at volumes typical for a cruiser - let alone a frigate - and the flexibility to adopt a competent direct-fire role as well, the Basileus commands begrudging respect from all but the least pragmatic Imperial commanders.

After looking past its striking lack of sex appeal, one can see this unassuming ship for what it is: a deliverer of death. It is clear that the Basileus' designers had to make certain sacrifices in order to fit a miniaturized autoforge into a standard frigate's berth, but the results speak for themselves. Few frigates - even the most advanced technological marvels employed by the Tri-Tachyon - can best a properly-equipped Basileus' time-to-kill.

Like most ships designed by the Interstellar Imperium, this hull is left underutilized; conspicuous design exclusions and unfilled modular slots harm the ship's base performance compared to similar vessels of other philosophies.

The Carrum-class actually serves as the basis for all other Imperial freighters, re-using the standardized cargo pod popularized by this unassuming hauler. It may not be glamorous, but many a quartermaster working for the Interstellar Imperium believe superstitiously that the Carrum is holy, blessed with luck and success by the Pantheon that designed it, and will angrily berate anyone who dares belittle the humble freighter.

Despite its on-paper statistics, the Decurion-class is only as good as its captain; the combination of flux-hungry weapons and short-term maneuverability is a reliable source of junior officer casualties.

Outfitting the Decurion properly can be a distinct challenge for fleet commanders. Careful consideration of the ship's maneuverability and flux budget is required to make the best of its capabilities, and poor-quality equipment can severely limit its effectiveness.

Somehow, this ship is able to ""borrow"" time from itself, apparently slowing down for a while before abruptly speeding up to an incredible degree.

ii_praetorian,SHIP,"The Praetorian-class is an aged design, by now firmly established as a noble symbol of the Imperium's dignity and valor. A ship that never managed to fall out of favor - even after the Collapse - largely thanks to across-the-board average performance numbers and a timeless fusion of adequate offense and adequate defense, like the sword and shield of old.

The Praetorian is by far the most popular warship in the entire Imperial armada, with more hulls having been constructed over the centuries than any other Imperium-tech ship, former or present. Though certainly better destroyers exist, few have the simplicity and none have the pedigree of this distinguished class.

ii_interrex,SHIP,"The swift and aggressive Interrex is favored by younger Imperial officers who see her blistering array of forward-only weaponry as a personal challenge. While this destroyer does indeed offer excellent firepower, its greatest strength is the ability to rapidly engage and disengage.

During post-mortem battle analysis, Imperial commanders can be quick to point out the Interrex's primary shortcomings: lacking the durability to survive over-committing and lacking the resources to pull out after rushing in too quickly. Indeed, it is easy to dismiss an otherwise excellent ship after seeing too many burned-out hulks drifting through the vastness of space, beloved officers and men incinerated after a direct hit from a stray reaper. However, with careful officer selection, the Interrex is practically untouchable, capable of pressuring the enemy, striking opportunistically, and getting away before anyone can catch up.

ii_legionary,SHIP,"The Legionary is a high-end destroyer currently serving as the Imperium's vanguard. Capable of incredible performance in short bursts, but requires a tricky combination of aggression and finesse to utilize effectively.

The Legionary-class shouldn't - and almost didn't - exist. Vulcan considered it to be a resounding failure, but Minerva couldn't let go of its potential combat specs, and Justitia simply adored how it looks. Outvoted, the AI god of Nova Capitalis devised a means for the Legionary to hit the performance Minerva hoped for, without ripping itself apart and prematurely detonating its own drive core in the process: the Overdrive system.

Overdrive works by essentially holding the Legionary back most of the time, only allowing its combat systems to reach 100% output for short bursts before needing to cool down. Towards the end of its carefully-calibrated envelope, the system ""redlines"", reaching a critical stage where the ship's onboard governors start to give out, exponentially increasing performance for a few moments. To avoid permanently damaging the ship, an emergency reactor shutdown prevents a runaway chain-reaction once the Overdrive gauge goes past a critical threshold soon thereafter.

The Princeps is far cheaper than a full cruiser-sized carrier, making it a practical option to add fighter support to a fleet without creating a liability at the same time.

Despite all of the Interstellar Imperium's technological marvels over the last few hundred cycles, ranging from time-warping phase ships to portable planet-busters, the deific AI Vulcan still considers the Princeps-class to be his true masterpiece of starship engineering. From afar, it doesn't seem like anything special, but any engineer who has seen the inner workings of a Princeps is struck by how close it comes to matching the Domain's best designs.

A miniaturized, phase-capable Shock Buster system is the Lynx-class's raison d'etre, capable of shaping the battlefield in innumerable ways, limited only by the captain's tactical prowess. Best deployed in tandem with more traditional warships.

Lynx captains have an uncanny tendency to become high brass later in their careers, owing to the ship's harsh demands on its officers and the wide variety of technical specializations a fully-qualified commanding officer is required to possess. Taking command of a Lynx is often considered a rite of passage for those with higher ambitions within the Imperium's military.

Its powerful, wide-arc shield makes the Libritor difficult to approach from the front, but it is especially vulnerable to flanking maneuvers. A flexible fast-recharge system allows the Libritor to fire multiple times in quick succession, should it have the opportunity.

Something of an anomaly, the Libritor resembles an enormous ballista from Old Earth antiquity, upon the insistence of the AI goddess Minerva. Despite the form-over-function approach, the Libritor's shape is generally considered a feature, rather than a flaw; widely-distributed armor assists in mitigating incoming damage.

The Ixon-class barely resembles the Falcon-class it was originally based upon. Designed to burn hot and bright, a great deal of advanced technology is packed into each squat hull, leaving little room for flexibility. A favorite of the AI deity Justitia, the best Ixons are designed for a singular purpose, overwhelmingly powerful at a specific role. It is for this reason that Ixons do best in groups; a pack of three or four is truly a force to be reckoned with.

A Sebastos has a little of everything: pieces of a strike cruiser, bits of a line cruiser, and even elements of a carrier. Despite being the Imperium's equivalent of a designed-by-committee hull, the ship somehow manages to work as a cohesive unit. With a long history of service since its inception, dispelling early criticism of its lack of focus with stories of success, the Sebastos-class has certainly earned its position within the Imperial armada.

The Dictator is a graceless pre-Pantheon behemoth of a cruiser, its weapon-heavy layout ideally suited for the overbuilt ammo-feeder system built into the hull. At its best, this ship combines heavy defense with heavy offense, a best-of-both-worlds approach that has stood the test of time. Just make sure it has faster escorts.

In practice, this means the Ardea-class is capable of handling itself in most types of combat engagements, able to do well regardless of whether the enemy is particularly carrier-prone or carrier-hardened. This flexibility is counterbalanced by the fact that a more specialized warship will be more effective when its strengths come into play.

Like the Heron-class it was based on, the Ardea-class relies most on flight decks for its combat capabilities. However, while the Heron's armaments are rather basic - to say the least - the Ardea is outfitted with a punishing-but-flexible array of weapons backed by a competent flux management system. As a result, the Ardea can contribute during intense combat in a way that the Heron simply cannot; rather than folding under pressure, this ship can continue to duke it out even after its fighter complement has been depleted.

Despite being fairly difficult to control and short-lived on the battlefield, the Adamas' versatility and power is a testament to Imperial ingenuity. Best known for having two sets of primary weapons that must be switched between in the heat of battle.

A recent design, the Adamas-class represents the technological peak of the Interstellar Imperium. Terribly difficult to manufacture and prone to production errors, few are spotted within Imperial fleets, and even then only the best officers and crew - usually veterans of the Imperial Guard - are permitted to wield it. Much like the older Legionary, this ship's dual-mode design was devised as a compromise to avoid having the ship burn itself out within the first moments of a pitched battle. Managing these two states is difficult, but rewarding; few things can turn the tide like a determined Adamas.

The Dominus-class boasts a powerful beam cannon and a pair of flight decks, but its true power comes from the ability to temporarily release all limiters, going into Overdrive.

The Dominus-class is an odd hybrid design, vaguely reminiscent of the older Sebastos-class in form and function. Like the Legionary, most of the Dominus' combat performance is locked away - only to be utilized in short bursts. It is a more self-sufficient ship than either the Legionary or the Sebastos, however, capable of diving into battle with most anything the Sector can throw at it. As for the ship's conspicuous flight decks, it is said that the Scutum fighter design was created alongside the Dominus specifically to be used together. While this may well be true, there are still great uses for a pair of full-scale flight decks beyond a mere defensive screen.

Uses the Shock Buster system to counter all but the most dedicated flanking maneuvers.

Although the Caesar-class is ultimately a failed venture - the Crocea Mors proved insufficient as a war-ending trump card - the base hull was so effective in field tests that the project came to fruition anyway, system requirements be damned. After managing to somehow devise a hull capable of out-fighting an Onslaught (by accident!) the Caesar was quickly - and permanently - pushed into its current position as the Imperium's sole service battleship.

The ability to control six flights of fighters as well as manage an entire capital-class warship's worth of weapons, all while managing a fleet of warships, is a daunting task for any commander. The Matriach-class was designed to help alleviate such high-level logistical concerns with an innovative dual-bridge layout, ensuring that the high-level command staff and the operational officers are able to work efficiently in separate environments built for a specific purpose. This makes the Matriarch unique amongst star-faring vessels in that it can actually have two commanding officers active simultaneously, both handing out orders to entirely separate crews in tandem.

Even after releasing its payload, the Olympus remains a threat on the battlefield, armed as it is with a surprisingly significant amount of secondary firepower.

The Olympus-class was developed to make the Titan practical enough to represent a serious threat to the Hegemony, both in terms of delivery speed and manufacturing accessibility. As the Titan blueprint is coded into the hull in order to permit field-replacement, the Olympus blueprint is a carefully-guarded state secret, rumored to exist only within the minds of the three AI gods that comprise the Pantheon.

Off-world farmers from Byzantium swear up and down that the Barrus resembles a gigantic ""space truck"".

Traian is protected only by its neutrality, a fact that its operators are keenly aware of as they distance themselves from the goings-on of politics.",,
ii_station_traian,CUSTOM,"This station is a compact orbital fortress built around an orbital synchrotron, ideal for the production of antimatter starship fuel. Volatiles are routinely shipped to the station to supply the rest of the Imperium with needed fuel. Notably, this vital installation is independently owned and operated, but ultimately answers to the authorities on Hadrian.",,The interior of this station can be best described as spartan. Rusted halls twist in a labyrinthine spherical shell around the beating heart of this orbital refinery. The walls creak and groan from centuries of neglect.,,
ii_planet_hadrian,CUSTOM,"Scarred with volcanoes and meteor impacts, the frigid surface of Hadrian is ideal for the collection of volatile gases, a task that is largely carried out by an autonomous workforce managed by a small army of engineers.",,"A high-ranking officer oversees the operations at Hadrian as well as coordinating with the nearby Traian Refinery. The few habitable areas are entirely utilitarian in design, built for work efficiency and well-armored against the rigors of Hadrian's atmosphere.",,
ii_planet_serdica,CUSTOM,"A huge ball of complex gases, this gas giant is stable and relatively inert. Serdica has captured several satellite moons, whose orbits run counter to the rest of the planetary bodies in Thracia.",,,,
ii_planet_perinthus,CUSTOM,"A geological and navigational hellhole, Perinthus is a haven for political dissidents, malcontents, and the youthful minority. The desperate people who live here are on the run from what they feel is the oppression of the Interstellar Imperium regime.",,"Surrounded by asteroids brought over by the Domain in a failed terraforming attempt, Perinthus is a desert-flooded world, rife with terrible sandstorms and sweltering heat. Perinthus is the harsher neighbor of Byzantium, whose bio-habitats encircle the spaceport in a vast shantytown: a ghetto for the Imperium's unwanted citizens.",,
ii_planet_cassus,CUSTOM,"This planet has a high density of cobalt, with massive veins of magnetic cobalt alloys buried under the surface. Though it is too small to capture an atmosphere, Cassus has an extremely powerful magnetic field, a fact that has made permanent settlement undesirable.",,"Cassus' magnetic field strengthens as you approach, making it impractical to land upon the desolate planet. Your scans pick up no signs of habitation.",,
ii_planet_aleria,CUSTOM,"Those who fall under the scrutiny of the Imperium can find themselves on a transport to Aleria, a ""correctional"" prison-world with ever-present demand for cheap labor. The dissidents, malcontents, criminals, and other sorts of unwanted persons sent here rarely leave; working conditions are harsh and compensation is minimal, but the Alerian entertainment industry is famous sector-wide.",,"Rich veins of ore flow like molten rivers on the hellish surface of Aleria. Newly-formed mountains surround calderas of molten ore, ringed by labor camps. The gravity is crushing, the atmosphere is thin, and the temperature on the surface is high enough to catch an unprotected human being on fire. Most people live in orbital habitats connected to the surface by a forest of space elevators.",,
ii_station_cydonia,CUSTOM,"One of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation's largest stations, Base Cydonia is linked to a large network of small mining platforms that orbit Cydonia. This station features a major dry-dock and a large autofactory, so it is always well-protected by corporate fleets, militarized industry, and the cover of the Corsican asteroid belt.",,"Cydonia fills your vision as you approach the endlessly-revolving station. Corporate fleets surround the area, guarding it from attack from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation's enemies in the system. Base Cydonia is impressively large, featuring many layers of industrial centers, residence sectors, and markets.",,
ii_planet_cydonia,CUSTOM,"A relatively small ice giant, rich in valuable industrial compounds. In low orbit inside Cydonia's hostile atmosphere, there are many automated collection platforms, mining useful resources from the planet. ",,"No habitable land exists on Cydonia. Rather, a large flock of open-dock industrial ships patrols the atmosphere, directly servicing the mining platforms and collecting their harvests.",,
ii_station_hades,CUSTOM,"Hades is a wretched hive of illicit trade and pirate activity, protected by asteroid cover and the battles raging elsewhere in the system. Undercover representatives for the Imperium, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, and the Hegemony are said to periodically visit to secure resource deals and hire privateers to aid in the war effort.",,"The dilapidated structure of Hades looks ready to break at any moment, seemingly held together by stubbornness alone. Countless dents and notches from decades of micro-asteroid impacts cover the station, a fact that the pirates living within willfully ignore.",,
ii_planet_arafa,CUSTOM,"Extremely large and possessing very low overall density, Arafa is a so-called ""puffy planet"". Due to its unsustainable size, Arafa constantly ejects its own atmosphere, creating a thick haze not unlike that of a nebula.",,,,

ii_planet_carthage,CUSTOM,"The sand-swept terrain of Carthage hosts a marginal but viable biosphere, making it a key strategic resource in Corsica. Regular attacks by the Interstellar Imperium and Tri-Tachyon Corporation threaten the planet's stability, so High Hegemon Command has placed Carthage under permanent martial law.",,"Carthage resembles a military base more than a spaceport; year-round patrols, numerous desert training camps, and weapons manufacturing centers are clustered inside large planetary fortifications. The effects of a prolonged war-on-two-fronts are clearly visible on the terrain, which is littered with craters and debris from downed starships.",,
ii_station_carthage,CUSTOM,"A fortified Hegemony military base, Carthage Station receives regular supply shipments and reinforcements to aid in the war effort against the other factions in Corsica.",,"Affixed to the main docking center of Carthage Station is a large sign that reads ""Carthago Delenda Est"", which you're told was placed there in mockery of the Interstellar Imperium. A steady stream of warships visits the station for repairs and refit, scarred from battle elsewhere in the system.",,
ii_planet_vetus,CUSTOM,"Vetus is uncharacteristically cold, despite its proximity to the Corsica binary pair. This is due to the fact that Vetus is permanently eclipsed by Arafa, causing virtually no sunlight to hit the moon. There were, at one point, plans to move Vetus closer to Arafa in order to alter its orbit, but the Collapse put an end to that idea.",,,,
ii_planet_mortalis,CUSTOM,"This moon was probably a rogue planet that eventually got captured by Arafa. Mortalis has an extremely long and fairly eccentric orbit, making it unsuitable for development.",,,,
ii_star_corsica,CUSTOM,"A blue supergiant, Corsica bleeds off its mass extremely quickly. Most of its planets are blasted-out, barren worlds with no hope of sustaining life.",,,,
ii_star_corsica_beta,CUSTOM,"Corsica Beta orbits Corsica Alpha in a semidetached binary system, slowly drawing material away from its larger partner. This star is surrounded by an accretion disk.",,,,
ii_station_embassy,CUSTOM,"A small listening post, ostensibly purposed as a no-man's-land political installation. It is widely thought that the Imperial Embassy exists to keep tabs on the Hegemony's movements on the edge of their territory, a task that the Yma system is uniquely suited for - legal complications prevent the Hegemony from taking direct action. Even so, supply runs are rendered impossible due to the Imperial Embassy's location well beyond the front line, forcing the station to accept trade with virtually anyone.",,"The faint yellow outline of Yma's corona seeps past Huascar's silhouette, shining wisps of leaked light upon this permanently-eclipsed station. This darkness mirrors the Imperial Embassy's tenuous grasp on existence, doomed to be annihilated by the Hegemony in the indeterminate future.",,
ii_planet_nova_capitalis,CUSTOM,"Nova Capitalis, the golden capital world of the Interstellar Imperium, is an exoplanet caught around the first-order barycenter of the Ex Vis star system. Here is the center of industry and administrative headquarters of the Imperium, established impromptu after the Collapse after being recognizing as an important strategic resource at the time. These days, however, Byzantium - economic giant and military bastion - overshadows Nova Capitalis as the de-facto center of the Imperium.",,"Desired for its unusual mineral composition and suitable temperature for sustaining life, an ancient Domain-era impulse propulsion system keeps the planet in a stable orbit, never straying too far toward one of the system's four stars. For all intents and purposes, Nova Capitalis orbits Ex Vis Gate, the old installation still keeping the hostile environment around it at bay.

The surface of Nova Capitalis appears golden, largely due to the fact that the planet is extremely rich in gold and other heavy metals, including much-desired transplutonics. Glistening mountain ranges, scenic river-carved canyons, and lush oases of arable land attract tourists from across the sector - provided they are willing to brave the gauntlet of injections necessary to withstand the noxious atmosphere.",,
ii_planet_sepulchrum,CUSTOM,"Whatever this planet may have once been is now wiped away, destroyed by centuries of annual meteor showers and titanic ion storms. Sepulchrum remains nothing more than an occasional navigation hazard.",,"If there ever was civilization on this planet, all trace of it is now gone. The red soil and cratered landscape are all that exist on Sepulchrum.",,
ii_planet_pulvis,CUSTOM,"A huge desert world, Pulvis is completely uninhabitable. The only noteworthy features of this hot planet are its planetary ring and several moons.",,,,
ii_planet_labes,CUSTOM,"Labes is virtually uninhabitable, due to its oppressive atmosphere of particulate lanthanides and various microbial xenotoxins. No colonization effort was made after the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation deemed this moon to be a hopeless case.",,,,
ii_planet_saltus_divinus,CUSTOM,"This small moon was originally colonized by a now-defunct expansionist corporation, centuries ago. After the hypergates went dark, various factors led to the total collapse of civilization on this world. It was only recently that the Church of Galactic Redemption reclaimed the moon, proclaimed it a holy site, and repaired the old machines to once again harbor human life.",,"Despite Saltus Divinus' small size, its mass is only slightly lower than that of Old Earth - allowing it to retain a heavy insulating atmosphere. While this prevents the surface water from boiling, this moon is extremely hot by human standards; even on the coldest nights, the atmospheric temperature can be likened to a warm bath. Many faithful journey to live on Saltus Divinus, but few stay for long; the experience is seen as a pilgrimage. This is also one of the few Luddic worlds where industrialized machinery is permitted - the hostile environment would be lethal without modern amenities.",,
ii_planet_remotum,CUSTOM,"A worthless dead rock, whisked around the Ex Vis system in an eccentric orbit. Several craters exist where pirates attempted, and failed, to establish an operating base.",,,,
ii_station_duality,CUSTOM,"An abandoned research station, apparently intended to study the oddities of the Ex Vis star system. Situated between two of the system's stars, Duality Research Station is slowly losing orbital stability and will fall into Ex Vis Tertius within a hundred cycles.",,"Duality Research Station could easily fit ten thousand souls inside its sweltering hull. Intense heat from the nearby stars, only somewhat dampened by stellar shades, has taken its toll on station infrastructure; your navigations officer advises you that it is best not to stay for long.",,
ii_ex_vis_gate,CUSTOM,"The Domain placed this gate atop the quaternary star system's primary barycenter, forever anchored in place between the four stars. Unlike most Hypergates, stories say that the Ex Vis Gate was designed to perform an additional function: stabilizing the local intrastellar medium. Centuries of neglect after the Collapse have reportedly caused those nonstandard systems to malfunction. No doubt, the remaining volume of habitable space will someday vanish.",,,,

ii_station_babylon_aotd,CUSTOM,"Once the Jewel of Byzantium, this station stands in defiance of the Collapse. A memory of the Domain's lost glory, this Stella Castellum is larger and more powerful than any station should be, by conventional wisdom. By rekindling the lost fire of humanity's industrial might, even a monument to the gods now bends to our cause.",,,,
interstellarimperium,FACTION,"The Interstellar Imperium was once a decentralized vassal-state of the Domain of Man, ruled by a council of Domain-approved local magistrates, each controlling assets within a particular sector of space. After the Collapse, the Persean arm of the Imperium was cut off from the rest, leaving the magistrate alone to consolidate power and crown himself Emperor Colligus I of the Imperium. Unlike most of the powers within the Persean Sector, the Imperium largely managed to maintain its meager holdings, actually growing stronger with time and avoiding annexation by the 14th Expeditionary Fleet.

Today, the Interstellar Imperium is considered to be a significant military and economic power in the Sector. The current Emperor, Victus II, continues his predecessor's policy of AI-driven societal control and optimization. The Hegemony and Luddic Church, both unwilling to accept the Imperium's flagrant use of Alpha-level administration, are in a near-perpetual state of warfare with them. Although these wars involve occasional clashes, a truly decisive victory for the Imperium's enemies is out of reach, for fear of reprisal with the Imperium's planet-killer stockpile.

The Imperium is a true empire, both in trappings and in reality, implementing draconian disciplinary policies, strict birth control, mandatory military service, stern cultural ethics, and pervasive hierarchical structures in society. In most cases, Imperial worlds are overseen partially - or in full - by artificial intelligence, permitting unmatched productivity at the cost of international outrage. Emperor Victus II's rule is uncontested, due in large part to his great success in bolstering the Imperium's base of power in the last few decades. His detractors attribute this recent success to the Emperor's ""Council of Advisors"", claiming that the council is a group of Alpha-puppeted androids. Such naysayers' warnings tend to fall on deaf ears, the powers-that-be tirelessly jamming rebel broadcasts and extraditing dissident individuals.

Of the Imperium's numerous AI governors, three are of particular note. Minerva is the administrator of Byzantum, master of warfare and trade. Vulcan is the administrator of Nova Capitalis, master of manufacturing and infrastructure. Justitia is the administrator of Aleria, master of societal conditioning and correction. These Alpha-level artificial intelligences are so deeply integrated into their respective worlds' infrastructure and society that they have, over more than a century of rule, essentially become de-facto gods for the Imperium. They are spoken of with the fear and respect deserving of deific, near-omniscient entities.",,,,
