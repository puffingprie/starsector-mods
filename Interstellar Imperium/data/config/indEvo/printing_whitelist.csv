# NOTES
# Ship IDs entered here will be allowed for duplication.
"# This feature is very hard to get working in campaign as a player, and lorewise, allows for duplication of even the most complex hulls."
"# Please do not go overboard with forbidding stuff here. Hulls that have been duplicated, can no longer be duplicated themselves, and are prone to malfunctions."
