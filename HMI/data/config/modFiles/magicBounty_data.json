This one leaps out for being rather weird: a Company client is requesting the elimination of a Company dealer. The reason? They're simping harder for a Fikenhild adult streamer than they are. You don't quite understand, but one of your bridge crew who happens to be a rabid follower of Westernesse media (un)helpfully explains Sweet_Sugar_Bath is the sexiest Switch streamer on the Westerness Relay, a position of some importance. Submission of credits to this Switch person is matter of life or death amongst Switch Subs, with greater credit sacrifices enabling them to rise to greater tiers of importance in the Sub hierarchy. Killing the target will enable this man to rise to greater levels of interaction with Sweet_Sugar_Bath, enhancing their prestige. Apparently. The money is bad, the return is terrible, and getting involved in this nonesense makes you feel more dirty than normal - but credits are credits.",

I'll just outlast you, just like how I'll outlast all those other posers who think that mistress Sugar is anything but a divine goddess!\"\n\nThe comms link goes off, as you turn to your bridge, eyebrow raised specifically at the officer fuming in the corner, mumbling vaguely about \"ungrateful sub\" and \"not even worthy to hear her fart through a telephone\". Your glare dares him to explain this nonesense, but he doesn't, and you're not sure whether to be thankful or annoyed.

        "job_description": "The Pirate Lord ==Captain Kidman== is one of the most reviled reavers of the Persean Sector, whose name is still feared on Argeus for his daring theft of an Onslaught from the shipbreaker's yard. The ship was retrofitted and turned into his flagship, and with a large fleet behind him he raided the Sector at large, gaining notoriety and infamy.\n\nThat, however, was cycles ago. And since then Kidman has fallen from grace, hounded by Hegemony patrols and rival pirate lords seeking a bounty, accumulated by the survivors of his many atrocities. His fleet, the ==Brawlin' Maries==, is now nothing more than a small handful of ships held together by his prestige, his legend, and his Onslaught mod flagship ==The Blameless==. However, pickings have been getting slimmer and slimmer, and the bounty hunters are closing in. A recent defector has recently released the location of the Brawlin' Maries on the wider Commsec network, and now it's open season on Kidman. His swan song is inevitable - but will you be the one to profit from it?",

        "job_description": "The Gentle Family is a notorious cult that stalks the outer reachs of the rim, cruelly preying on isolated polities and decivilised colonies to sustain them on their Sacred Exodus. This extremist cult is lead by the charismatic ==Daniel Gentle==, and firmly believes that only the devout followers of ==Daniel Gentle== will be spared the coming fires of an omnipotent and omniscient being the Rex Mundi, that only they can see through his lies, that only they have souls to preserve and be sent to heaven by the Lord's Will. To them, everyone else is a Hollowman, a soulless husk that is used by a puppet of the Rex Mundi. Crimes committed against a Hollowman do not count, as they are not real people - something that members of the Family use as an excuse for truly breathtaking atrocities done by themselves and ==Daniel Gentle==. Some, however, are real people blinded by the Rex Mundi, and their souls can be saved through an extensive process involving torture, coercion  and mind-altering drugs. If, after being tested on their faith and loyalty to ==Daniel Gentle== they prove devout, they too join the Cult. If they do not, then they are treated little worse than slaves, often executed by being thrown out the airlock during a sermon aboard the ==Good Ship Gentle==.\nFor the most part the Gentle Family stayed too far away from the core systems to even register on the major polity radar, however recently ==Daniel Gentle== has been moving closer and closer to the Core, with the aim of attacking Gilead. There, he will ascend to heaven along with his followers, and the Sector will be purged for their grevious sins.\n\nThe Luddic Church, not particularly wanting a crazed lunatic at the head of a giant fleet attacking what might be the most sacred site to the Luddic Faith, has posted a bounty for the Family's destruction - a bounty enhanced by survivors of the Gentle Family's cruelties.",

		"job_comm_reply": "\"Well hello there!\" says Daniel Gentle charmingly, \"Come to join the Family? Or are you here to test your faith?\"\nHe leans forward, smile bright and soft, \"I don't mind either way, the Family treats everyone with kindness. And when you've passed on from your own foolishness in testing our faith, we'll be sure to show far more hospitality to the survivors of your pride. Anyone can join the Family, and be welcomed amongst our brothers and sisters - if their soul is true and faith strong. Rejoice, sisters and brothers! Your salvation from the Rex Mundi is come!\"",
