What the hell is happening to this sector?\nED's latest and greatest technology demonstrator, the \"Chupacabra\" has been stolen after integrating some top secret weaponry. Standardish stuff so far.  Where it gets interesting is Tri-Tachyon initiated the heist by having a black ops team integrate an Alpha Core trained in exfiltrating ships from 'complex' situations.  Well as soon as this core was fully integrated into the Chupacabra it promptly killed the team and the skeleton crew of the ship then flew off into Remnant controlled space.\nYou're one of the few pilots with a fleet we can count on to destroy this ship and stop whatever machinations are at work here.\nCuriously, for as good as that exfiltration core was at escaping, it sure doesn't seem to be making any effort to conceal its location so it could be some sort of a trap.  But at least that means we know it's exact location.",
