If you command a small mercenary fleet, we wish to offer you a legally binding elimination contract. Cooperate with the Corporation interests, get handsomely rewarded, and be granted  profitable opportunities within Tri-Tachyon space in the future!.\nThere's a former task force fleet that went rogue and ran away with Tri-Tachyon goods, failing to uphold their contract terms. Their captain was a low rank military officer, ==$name==. Your job is to find and decimate the entirety of the fleet by any means, preferably starship weapon fire. We are not interested in prisoners or salvage and will not grant extra credits for any of them. It is mandatory that captain $firstname is eliminated.\nCaptain, although they are nothing but pirates at this point, these ships are advanced combat vessels piloted by professional combat pilots. Captain $name commands a Shrike-class destroyer as $hisHerTheir flagship. Caution is advised before engaging them in combat.\nLastly, if you happen to find any of the stolen items, bring them to any Tri-Tachyon Station Commander and you will be adequately rewarded for them. The mission terms don't include bringing the items back, since it is not assured that Hoxe still has them.\n$name's fleet has been located near $location in the $system system.",

How curious -laughs and chuckles can be heard near $lastName-. This is gonna be fun. Do you think the Corp gives a damn about you? You are just another expendable, delusional fool if you thought this would be an easy job.\nEngage combat protocols. Prepare to die, scum.'",

Eventually, this band of convicts was forged into a half-decent band of scumbags, more than capable of surviving the trivial patrols assigned to them./nOn their way back from a routine sortie, the penal unit conspired to kill the officer and seize control of the fleet.

    "job_description": "Disputes among the Eventide elite of the Hegemony are almost always shrouded in gossipy silk, not slugged out with DU or hellbore rounds. Though the Hegemony gives a fair amount of local autonomy as long as taxes are paid and political dissenters are rooted out, interfamily fighting is strongly discouraged, as it would bleed away manpower and materiel needed for reuniting the Sector.\nA few days ago, that tacit rule was broken. A high society dispute ended in scandal, then in a suicide, and then in an angry $fatherMotherParent extracting bloody vengeance upon an entire crowd of the Hegemony's upper crust. Nothing in the last two hundred cycles of Eventide drama could compare to this crime upon crimes. The pressure is on the local governor to solve the situation immediately, before the white-gloved consensus of the Hegemony ruling class is shattered forever.\nAfter the massacre at Eventide, the angry $fatherMotherParent escaped with all the wealth of a grand Eventide house. The governor has no clues, no hints, nothing to show where all those ships and spacers have absconded overnight. Even COMSEC, for once, is silent. The only thing you know is that an incredible fortune and plaudits upon plaudits are yours for the having, if you can hunt down those responsible.",

    "job_description": "This particular posting seems just a little bit strange from a first glance. It's an extremely rare sight to find a job offer from someone most likely affiliated with VIC in broad daylight in such sort of networks, but here we are, even if they try to hide the tracks as much as possible and label themselves as \"anonymouse benefactor protecting corporate interests\". Perhaps, the corps' own hands are too full of other things to take care of? Or someone does indeed wish to earn the Conglomerate's favour by these sort of means for whatever reason. Nonethelss, no matter what the truth is, the reward looks enticing enough to consider the offer. \n\"A not really promising documentary series filmmaker from Hegemony has been building their questionable publicity by portraying the VIC in an unfavorable light, using, as they say, \"extensive anonymous interviews\", \"confidential footage\", and the so called \"leaked corporate plans\". As one can easily imagine, almost all of it is just a crude re-interpretation of what's already been openly stated by the megacorp's Public Relations Department long time ago. However, the whole ordeal still hurts the image of their partnership with the Hegemony and sows the seeds of distrust among the populace. Normally it wouldn't take long for the production to get shut down and the documentary being justly branded as public defamation, but for some unexpected reasons, the process is being a bit too slow, and the reputation of the Conglomerate is yet to be protected adequately. Thus, a more direct approach is required for the time being. \nMake sure the aforementioned filmmaker misses their upcoming interview, and other contractors will take care of the rest. Apply force at your own discretion, if needed of course\".",
    "job_comm_reply": "The director almost jumps in their place, being startled from a sudden comm signal. Their forehead shimmering with little beads of sweat, concentration and focus quickly leaving the laden mind. They look as if ready to start screaming at you through the screens, but by some unknown virtue manage to suppress their emotions after a lengthy, almost meditative-looking exhale. \"Please. Please, please, please. Don't maneuver into the frame, we've been waiting for this precise planetary-stellar position for almost an entire cycle. Okay, okay, I'll give you an autograph and a chat after we're done, just don't interrupt us right now. The Art is in making...\" The filmmaker returns to their work, looking away from the comm screens and completely forgetting to turn them off. Would be quite a shame if such enthralling labour didn't bear any fruit in the end.",
  	"job_intel_success": "The deed is done, and the payment comes in rather quickly after sending all the required confirmations. Soon enough, the news about the filmmaker's sudden disappearance start spreading through the networks, most of the discussions heavily moderated and yet still full of conspiracy theories of all sorts, only adding to the murkiness of the situation and burying what's little left of the truth. The mysterious \"benefactor\" is nowhere to be found, even if you paid the more experienced people to try and fish them out of the convoluted web of proxies. Surely, something is brewing between the Conglomerate's and the Hegemony's parties with quite a lot of other people involved, but you know better than to jump right into the pool of carnivorous xenofish.",

You've been makin' some noise over 'ere, to me it sounds like you want to make it in one of our crews. Tell you what, forget all ya've learned about us \"pirates\", we're just simple entrepreneurial spirits looking to make a quick buck. Not all of us resort to pillaging and looting, some of us even take contractor work, it's one step up from the common rabble.\"\nYou're quite surprised by how eloquent he is, but the next thing he says takes you off-guard: \"You know, no big difference between me and your average Hegemony chump, or Sindrian citizen, or Tri-Tachyon corporate figure, we're all people! Mmm, maybe scratch that last one out, but you get what I'm tryin' to say. Anyways, let me get to the point.\"\nThe man begins what seems to be a rant, about conditions and life in the sector, but he does get to the job at hand, as promised. \"I like to race, ya get me? I do that for money, and many other things. I bust my hide for people who don't really see eye-to-eye with me. Hegemony military, Tri-Tachyon corporate types, even for the academically inclined, those guys are more open to my shenanigans. But racing gets the blood pumping, you know!? Lately, there's been this chump, ==$name==. A pirate in name only, if you will. I say that because it's clear $heSheThey only ever ran Tri-Tachyon jobs, to the point where $heSheThey got a nice severance package from them. Anyways, this package includes ==one of their really spooky prototype gunships, and $firstName made it into a death trap.== I'm saying, ==engine modifications, $heSheThey really voided the warranty on that sucker, ya get me?== And because of that, I want you to ==take it and turn it into Tri-Tachyon scrap.== Ever since $firstName got that ship, racing's not what it used to be. And more people share my sentiment. Not enough of them, since $heSheThey still spend time ==around our stations, most of the time==. All I'm sayin' is, most of us would be pleased if that thing didn't exist anymore. Or $himHerThem. If you want a ==quick way to a reputation with us 'less reputable folks'==, this is the way to do it, ==but do it fast. Get in, get done and get gone==. Notoriety pays around these parts, and I'll make sure you get paid.\"\nThe transmission ends and you're left with a decision.",

And without even time to take a breath, you get hailed. \"If you want any autographs, get lost. Go have a chat with my merchandise division for that sorta stuff.\"\nYou can definitely sense that $heIsSheIsTheyAre enjoying the corporate lifestyle a bit too much from $hisHerTheir tone.
