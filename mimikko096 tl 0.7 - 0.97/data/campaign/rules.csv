The card face is not simple cardboard, instead, some strange material has been added to the mix. No matter how you fold it, it always returned to its original state without any visible markings. 

The polished backing of the card is glowing under the crisp lightning of the room, like a silver nebula.

The Ace of Spade on the front of the card is like a black hole eating away at the nebula, creating a contrast with the thorny decorative pattern around the border. In the corner of the card is a beautiful A written in the artistic font of the old earth.

""The kingdom doesn't have technology like the Captain's world, but it has a lot of mana, although only some can absorb them to cast spells."" Clearly, Nonona is one of those elites.

You heard Nonona talk about her father, although he had left Nonona very early, he had taught countless knowledge to Nonona.

""With the Captain here, Zero feels very safe, let's hurry!"" Zero's voice is a lot more energetic compared to earlier on the ship.

After sometime navigating through the maze like corridors, the two of you have arrived before one lit up gate. The moment you approached, hidden turrets appeared from the walls, all of them locked on to You instead of Zero.

""Captain, do not be afraid, they are the guards for this building."" Zero spoke to you as she allowed the gate's sensor to scan her. It seems this building contains the secret of Zero's origin, everything about zero, being an AI that has her own emotions, an AI even more superior than Alpha Core...... While you are still lost in thought, the gate opened. You arrived at what seems to be a decontamination chamber, which seems a bit safer than outside. After a thorough decontamination procedure, you are finally able to enter this underground facility to discover everything about Zero.

You see Zero's head buried in your chest, decontamination spray pooled and streamed down her cheeks like tears. Zero sobbed "".......Ze, Zero would not abandon the captain. Cap, Captain is the most important person to zero!"" At this moment, you can no longer see Zero as an AI, she is a real person, a real person with thought and feeling of her own.

After the gate opend, Zero did not act at first ""Captain......actually, Zero isn't really sure how to face creator. Ze, Zero just want to tell creator that Zero is safe with the captain right now, and creator-sama doesn't need to be worried.""

Even abandoned, Zero still longs for her creator, and still wonders whether creator though about her safety. Perhaps, telling her creator that she is safe is her way of finally cutting her ties.

After a period of searching, the two of you failed to find a single person in the research lab. The only sounds are the footsteps of you and Zero. In the end, you reached a gate at the end of a closed corridor, on the gate is a plethora of warning symbols and a sign indicating ""Top Secret"". It is clear that the gate wants to tell everyone not to enter, but this did not stop the two of you, you quickly opened the gate.

After a bit more searching, you found an individual thats more complete than the rest on a repair table. Upon closer examination, you see she is dressed very similar to Zero, with the similar databand, though she seems turned off.

The two of you returned to the facility, zero looked at her surrounding, her hands uncontrollably reached for her chest. Perhaps a scene like this too scary for a robot like her. ""Zero has her researcher-samas talked about it, this is their new project..."" Zero's voice grew quiet, perhaps this is the reason for Zero's abandonment?

She quielty walked around the test table, carefully examining the grown up version of herself.

If you are lucky enough to see yourself in ten years, you probably can't remain calm like Zero is right now.

O, she truly is an AI with emotion.

""Ariana, used to pioneer new colony, to serve the people, and to protect them."" Zero focused on working through the controls, while telling you about Ariana. ""Captain, please connect the Alpha Core from earlier."" Zero pointed at the exposed machinery nearby and gestured you to connect the core there.

The technology here have never been revealed to the Persean Sector, but the computational power of an Alpha core is without questioning. Zero's work is as efficient as always, precise and to the point.

""This will allow Ariana to recognize captain as her master, she will protect the captain as well, and zero.......will have an older sister!"" Said Zero after she inputed what seems to be your biometric. ",5:mimikko_arianameet_9:Ask your crew to bring an Alpha Core,,,

After Ariana stood up and saw you, her azure eyes suddenly glowed before returning to its original brightness. Maybe she is processing data, maybe scanning? ""Captain?"" Ariana's voice has a lot less emotion than Zero's. Suddenly, Ariana raised her arm, which transform to show hidden weapon aimed at other crews behind you, Ariana seems to believe they are hostile targets. You quickly stopped Ariana and explained that they are friends.

""Friend?"" Hmm, the captain's freind"" Ariana stoop up and scanned her surroundings, she seems to be curious about this world. At this point, Zero speaks up ""Big Sister! Big Sis Ariana!""

The park is quite large, so you have a long way to go, and the star of this system has gradually disappeared off the horizon. You sighed at how busy it is to be a captain, having never gotten a closer look at this planet.

Why would this be in a natural reserve? You checked your surroundings, and it is quiet as usual, and another identical statue is across from this one. Behind the statue is a plant covered path.

Miruko's head is lowered, she stares at her finger quietly. Miruku replies: ""Since when we had memory, we have been living in a lab. Until a group of people captured all the researches whose been teaching us, and Miruko helped me escape that place...""Miruku now also lowers her head and gazed blankly infront of her, finally losing her lady-like posture.

You see Miruko's tail swing back and forth like a happy puppy, you can't help but patted Miruko's head.  

At first, she closed her eyes and enjoyed yourself, her ear and tail wiggled even faster. Then, Miruko suddenly realized something and leaned back, ""Captain, do you pat girls on the head often, why are you so good at it!""

You parked the shuttle nearby and approached on foot.

You arrive at the hedge outside the cabin, though the hedge is not high and you can easily flip over with one hand, you decided to show respect and ring the little bell beside the gate. ",10:mimikko_sunameet_3:Suna!,,,

Her hat and clothing is similar to Nonona's, but not completely the same. There are clear skull markings on her cloths, and a few bells adorn the edge of her dress, she held on to a decorated wodden staff in her hand, flowers grew on the staff, and the staff is topped by a crisply cut, glowing pink crystal. Suna is also surrounded by several butterfly that flew out and hovered around the girl.

Suna give you a strained smile, it must be difficult for someone living so far from a city to trust a stranger. You handed the round disk in your pocket to Suna, who accepted it with both her hands, you amaze at the fact that her staff have suddenly disappered!

She is a sorceress skilled in nature magic and necromancy. While it sounds terrifying, Suna explained she is not an evil existence like you might have imagined. Suna doesn't like conflict between people and rather live with various small animals, and she can understand the thought of those animals.

You still have no idea about all that magical stuff, ever since Nonona and Yurika came to your side, some of your researcher even begin shouting things like ""Physics no longer exist"". Maybe magic depends on talent afterall, well, you sure have no chance to really get in touch with magic.

It is very unusal to see a beautiful girl with such moving voice in a fringe sector like this. Though you didn't put much thought to it and focused on the girl onstage. Her uniform is glowing orange gold, and her golden hair waved in the air along with her dance. With a flash of smoke and flame, her golden hair turned into red, glowing even brighter than the stage lights.

As the symbol of Persean Justice, you cannot let this happen, you decided to be the hero that saves the damsel in distress. You contacted your first officer to explain the situation, and they are excited about it as well, it's been a while since they've seen some big action.

You quietly followed the kidnappers to a hanger, they seems to be waiting for their accomplices to pick them up. The pirates have control of this area, evident by the few uniformed dead body on the ground.

""Miss Xihe, someone paid good price for ya"" A pirate grabbed Xihe by the chin, but before he could do anything, he was bitten on the hand, forcing him to let go. ""You perverts, keep your dirty hands away from me! Or better yet, cut it off!"" Even with her arms and legs tied, Xihe's expression remains one of anger. The pirate is also furious, just as he raised his hand to slap her, another hand stopped her, ""Don't break the good, the boss wants her unharmed."" Another pirate grabbed the man's hand, his voice calm, as though used to this kind of business.

Xihe's body and hair are covered by explosion left from the earlier explosion, you agilely dodged another bite from her when you removed her gag. ""You insect, trash, you are worse than insect!""

Seeing the area around is clear, you called your officer to take you out of here. The others begin to secure the perimeter, you just need to wait for a shuttle to take you from this corpse filled place.

You look at Xihe, despair filled her eyes. You can't really leave her here with a gang of pirates looking for her, so you gave her an invitation.

Her peripheral vision notices your smirk, she immediately adds ""but still a pervert.""

A small shuttle from the outside interrupted your conversation with Xihe, a scan indicates this isn't the one to pick you up. The hatch open and a bald guy came out, after looking at your squad and the pile of pirate corpse, he ran back into the shuttle and started the engine.

You notice Xihe's expression is a bit strange.

Xihe smiled with her eyes closed, then she put on a serious and scary expression and spoke to you ""Say, don't you have some work to do?"" You look at the hand you've been holding, it is so delicate and tender, looking up you see Xihe's stern smile at you. Truly her personality doesn't match her looks. You quickly let go, and Xihe looked like she doesn't want to look at you either, and took out a handkerchief to wipe your hand.

You hear the song from the beginning behind the door, though it is simply a hum, you are sure that is the same song, right and proper. ""You! I almost choked.""

Your firm but soft cloth hat turned into a straw hat, the bright sunlight makes it hard to open your eyes. What is this place?

You are not on the bridge, not on your bedroom, but you are surrounding by comfortable temperature and air, and the building around you are humble and ancient. You crawl up from the straw pile and patted yourself, your cloths have also turned into simple fabrics. You still cannot figure out what is going on, as you tried to call your first officer, you realize your implant is no longer working, or rather, your implant has disappered.

""Your Honor..."" Thes sound appeared again, you look beside you and saw a child with silver blue hair looking up at you, a horn in the center of forehead catches your attention. THe girl's eyes seems to be glowing like stars, a halo-like object is over her head, not to mention she even has a pair of wings behind her back ""Go find big sister...""She didn't wait for your response, with a blink, the child is gone.

Everything is so primitive here, there are no sign of modern science in this place.

However, the passerby does not have an apperance like hers, or the wings, they just look like normal people, strange, isn't it.
