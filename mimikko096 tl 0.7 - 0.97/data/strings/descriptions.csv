mimikko_kasutaria_torpedo,WEAPON,"""Captain, this is the power from the old paradise: A mockery from [REDACTED]. If you insist on using it, you may attract unwanted attention. But let's not talk about this... Why don't you try Ria's knee pillows?""",- Kasutaria,,,
mimikko_kasutariri_beam,WEAPON,"""Until she appeared beside Riri, Riri doesn't deserve to have any of this. Father, Riri is willing to trade Riri's place in paradise that protects her from any [REDACTED] corruption or harm. In the father's name, Amen.""",- Kasutariri,,,

mimikko_zero_fighter,SHIP,"""Captain, Zero is not angry. Cannot be angry. Being needed. Makes me very happy. Zero can feel this. From Zero's soul. Not from Zero's program. Zero. Is happy.""",- Zero,,,
mimikko_nonona_paragon,SHIP,"No one ever told Nonona how dangerous the Persean Sector could be, but it doesnt make her any less cautious. When you first saw this ship, trying to make out the runes and spell circles covered surface is like trying to make sense of a Tri-Tachyon database, and thats only the surface.  She once said that she is the last fortress for this world. After you have witnessed Yurika's power, you believe that's no exaggeration at all. The Demon Lord's presence is a threat to the world, but she graciously left a final fortress for mankind. That said, this is a story for another time. Now, Yurika and Nonona are the best of friends, regularly bantering with each other.

The interior of the Song of Stars is filled with alchemical pipings, and you have no idea how Nonona accomplished this. While the ship looks ancient, making it almost unfit for basic space travel, its overall performance is no different from the most successful battleship of the expansion era - the Paragon-class. The tide of magic flow within excited you, given that you're an ordinary person who has never seen magic before. Indeed, This is the fusion of magic and alchemy.

mimikko_kasutariri_radiant_1,SHIP,"You shall heed his teaching, spread his tale, and demonstrate his glory. In return, he shall promise you paradise for all of eternity.

mimikko_yurika_onslaught,SHIP,"This ship seems like a regular Onslaught-class, but its core engine and weapons have undergone significant refit. The forward venting pipes and massive structures have been simplified and filled with a strange energy collection system not of this world. The core of this system is a strange prism that has been corrupted by unknown energy.

This ship was salvaged with no cryopods and no identification. The only records that could be found was a thick paperback note and a large amount of mining equipment. This method of record-keeping is reminiscent of old Earth, and the words within are illegible. But based on some of the pictograms inside, it seems a horned little girl has lived with what you assume to be the crew of this ship. They all lived happily together until one day when the crew dug up a crystal that seemed to resonate with the little girl's special power...",,,,

mimikko_burndrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Divert the prism and magical energy to erupt the ship's engines and increase its output. During this time, the ship cannot use its shields, and it runs the risk of full engine flameout on any significant collision.",,,,

mimikko_nemuri_station,CUSTOM,"A mysterious room that seems abandoned. If not for the high sensitivity of the sensor, most people would ignore this minor wave.",,,,

mimikko_mint_core,RESOURCE,"The mInT-class core has assimilated the advanced calculation algorithm of an alpha core, enhancing its combat capabilities to match those of a beta core and greatly improving its multi-level target finder. The system allows it to provide detailed target information for the fleet. Ariana left it in your care so that it could be trained further with more combat data.",,,,

#minipulser,WEAPON,"""试验台毁了。所以,那又如何呢。我们递交的明细清单里已经预估了人员和财产损失，但重要的是我们最终得到了想要的成果，也没有失去任何高级研究员。你猜怎么着，我马上就去现场，亲自监督安装全新的巡洋舰级别护盾。""",- K. Astraia，数据恢复自 Kallichore 留存的档案,,,
#shockrepeater,WEAPON,"""不知怎么的它就穿过了封锁线，来到了支援小队的正中央。在护航队的野狼把它干掉之前就把运输船的设备烧得一干二净。传感器，导航仪，维生系统，全完蛋了。我们现在是有能够吃一辈子的冷冻蓝龙虾了，但是第三代空气循环设备倒是歇菜了。我觉得后者才是你们现在比较需要的东西。""",- 一条被}速子科技}员工士气保障部拦截的信息，附于员工处置报告中,,,
